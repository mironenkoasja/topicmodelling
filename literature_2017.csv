Lawrence's The Rainbow' offers a reading of The Rainbow that foregrounds Lawrence's criticism of Britain's public educational system. In short, I argue that the first of the Ursula Brangwen novels contains a powerful indictment against state-promoted public education. Through a heart-rending depiction of Ursula's traumatic experiences as a public-school teacher, Lawrence exposes four crimes committed against the individual during the educational process - normalization, shame, capitulation, and violence. Employing the psychological theories of Sylvan Tomkins, I posit that Lawrence's complex treatment of shame in this novel necessitates a re-examination of The Rainbow, one that reconfigures the historical and literary context in which it is often read.",50,"WOS:000414003400003",3
"English","rhyme; affirmation; imagination; Shelley; Wordsworth; Coleridge",,"'Gleam' and 'dream': the rhyme performs a quintessential Romantic pairing and serves as a window opening on to the topic of rhyme in poetry of the period, not least through the serendipitous way in which it off-rhymes with the word 'rhyme' itself. Rhyme is a matter of spanning or failing to span abysses in Romantic poetry as much as it is an earnest of some ultimate harmony or fulfilment. The word 'gleam' suggests an intimations-inducing flash of light; 'dream', for its part, points towards a possibly insubstantial source or vehicle of embodiment or quest or longing. On the face of it, the coupling may seem as hackneyed as any scorner of Romantic verbal effects might wish. Yet Romantic poetry generates an 'electric life', in Shelley's words in A Defence of Poetry, from this and comparable verbal interknittings, The essay pays particular attention to the rhyme of 'gleam' and 'dream' in various poems, and then to rhyme's intratextual and intertextual effects in poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge; it returns at its close to themes of aspiration and affirmation often resonating through Romantic rhyme.",14,"WOS:000404884500002",3

What its various sub-fields share is that they are concerned, very broadly, with narratives that transcend the parameters of conventional realism. One of the field's promises is that it can also account for earlier 'unnatural' narrative scenarios, for instance in ancient and medieval literature. Focusing on two recent publications by Alber and Richardson, this essay challenges the historical trajectory the movement envisages. Paying special attention to the influence of religion on premodern narratives and its implications for the concept of the unnatural, this essay argues that unnatural narratology is reductionist and adheres to a structuralist paradigm, and thus cannot do justice to the idiosyncrasies of premodern narrative forms and functions. An alternative approach to the unnatural as a dynamic form is introduced as an outlook.",57,"WOS:000399451200001",3

Driven by his moral conscience, Auden attempted to use his art to affect the public in order to call for a change in refugee policy by asylum countries.

This logistics of travel relies to a large extent of the usage of different lists. This paper discusses how different sorts of travel lists evolved, and to do this I turn to three historical types of travel list. First I briefly discuss the role of lists in early modern travel, a time before guidebooks or the modern concept of tourism. This historical account shows us how traveling and the generation of knowledge are intrinsically linked. Then, in the main part of the essay, I discuss different types of lists in early travel guides (such as Baedeker) as crucial cultural techniques for organizing and navigation. This leads me to a brief discussion of the contemporary usage of user-generated travel lists in social media (such as TripAdvisor). What is common to these heterogeneous lists is that they are not simply neutral instruments; rather, they are logistical techniques for generating knowledge. Analyzing different types of travel lists and their intersections shows that different imaginaries of space and time emerge; notably it helps us to understand how travel lists have become tools of valuation.",31,"WOS:000416201700005",3
"English",,,"A blackened, burned dress hangs limply in an upstairs wardrobe in a dusty, deserted house in the Fens in Ruth Rendell's The Brimstone Wedding (1996). This dress, like the airless, loveless, and love-lost houses in both The Brimstone Wedding and The Secret House of Death (1968) serves as a reminder of false romantic promises, the emptying out of desire into the mundane, the dangers and betrayals both of passion and of the everyday domestic. This is Rendell's domestic Gothic at its best. In both Rendell and her alias Barbara Vine's more psychological thrillers, the twin comforts of romance and a safe home and family give way to disturbance, discomfort, disease, and disruption. Romance is treacherous and betrayed. However passionate, stolen, turbulent, and filled with promise, it slips away at a single deceptive act or through the repetitive, mundane everyday. Its worst outcomes are cruelty following the end of love or the equally destructive, mind-numbingly banal winding down into lovelessness. Clandestine love nests are cleared out and shuttered up; suburban family life is devalued. Each is prone to absences, deceit, and death. Much of Rendell's domestic Gothic has echoes of Daphne du Maurier's earlier influential genre-shifting romantic crime Gothic Rebecca (1938), and this novel's haunting of our reading of Rendell's texts underpins the discussion of The Brimstone Wedding and The Secret House of Death. Both use strategies of women's crime entwined with romantic domestic Gothic to undermine thoroughly investment in romantic love, domestic bliss, and the security of the family home.",31,"WOS:000398033400005",3

But except where they have to do with similarities or differences as to, say, age or physicality or situation, comparisons between persons often seem unduly subjective and, in many cases, even fallacious.

Drawing on and enriching this tradition, the English rhetoricians of Shakespeare's day defined the figure as the repetition of the word or words with which one phrase or line ends, at or near the beginning of the succeeding phrase or line. A series of anadiploses was understood to make for a gradatio (or climax). Having been schooled in these and other definitions of the tropes and figures, Shakespeare implements anadiplosis, as well as the rhetoricians' rich metaphorical description of it, in his text. In so doing, he enhances his representation of people who are impassioned, thoughtful, witty, deranged, and ridiculous. In keeping with the rhetoricians' recognition of the polysemy of the figure, Shakespeare also implements this figure to narrate events and make some of them seem inevitable (usually in history and tragedy) and others unlikely (usually in comedy). The Shakespearean script also frequently includes dialogic anadiplosis: the sharing of the figure by two speakers.

Spatiality is crucial in understanding this novella, which can be read as secondary travel writing: it is partly a response to a travel narrative by Rene Caillie published in 1830. Useful here are critical approaches to travel narratives such as Mary Louise Pratt's notions of the ""contact zone"" and the ""anti-conquest"" narrative.

Written in blank verse, the play's poetic style and wealth of inter-textual references to personal and public history attest to Barnes's aesthetic savvy and modernist sensibility. Not only does the play rely on the kind of role-switching associated with Platonic dialogues whereby materiality is excoriated to give way to purer, loftier ideas, but it also deploys a quest for state (or family) justice as a theatrical performance that is strong on stylized politics, but short on ethics and ideas. In its blending of the political and the abstract, The Antiphon evokes what Alain Badiou refers to in Rhapsody for the Theatre as a ""theatre of ideas"" that combines an artistic ""heresy in action"" with a ""figurative reknotting of politics"" (13). In The Antiphon, such ""reknotting"" not only points to the destructive politics permeating 1930s and 1950s America, but also exposes Barnes's search for a method that would simultaneously rupture and transcend the very limitations of art forms by transforming politics into a philosophically-charged theatre of ideas.",40,"WOS:000416780200013",3

"English",,,"A short manuscript fragment, A Rabelaisian Rhapsody (1898-1900), affords us a unique and overlooked insight into the structures and key concerns of J. M. Synge's entire dramatic oeuvre. A Rabelaisian Rhapsody reveals, firstly, Synge's early conceptions and ideals of drama as a form; secondly, the dialogue is used to express a more wide-ranging 'creed' of aesthetic, moral and spiritual value in different literary approaches; thirdly, it links both of these to particular modes of theological thought, thereby illustrating how the structures, forms and textures of Synge's later drama are rooted in a pressing desire to anchor literary expression to spiritual wellbeing. The ironic and dialectical structures found in this piece form the core structures of Synge's dramatic thought, and are drawn from both Old Irish literature and contemporary political debates, as well as from the symbolist thought of Yeats, Blake and others. In The Well of the Saints (1905), we find the final synthesis of this structure, and the preparation for Synge's overt sociological statements regarding modernization in Ireland. Over many years, Synge established a spiritual basis for his aesthetic, countering asceticism with pantheism, restriction with Rabelaisian excess. The various iterations of this conflict can be traced over numerous dialogues, scenarios and plays in his oeuvre, and this dialectical structure became subsumed into a larger literary vision of nonconformity and multidirectional irony. In turn, Synge's spiritual and aesthetic opposition to ascetic or conforming figures began to influence his understanding of political and social change in contemporary Ireland.",40,"WOS:000411226000008",3

This article juxtaposes and interweaves these debates to show that articulacy twice attempted to lay total claim to knowledge; on each occasion, the effort to protect literature and ambiguity spurred Swift and Arnold to discrete imaginative acts engendered by the same anxiety over minute scholarship. It is suggested this disquiet was especially acute because the techniques of satire and artistry made those forms appear less disinterested and more pedantic than they professed to be, whilst Bentley's philological work was truly exemplary of the vital creativity Swift and Arnold espoused.

Across disciplines, this set of approaches has emerged concurrently with the arrival of increasingly powerful computing technologies. This paper examines the novel Exchange Place by Ciaran Carson, applying Katherine Hayles's concept of 'chaotics' to the text to read for established chaotic features including unpredictability, complex forms, nonlinear relationships and multi-scalar representations. Foregrounding interactions between chaotics as proposed in the 1990s and contemporary post-digital environments, I highlight three distinguishing elements of Exchange Place, which are explained and illustrated through close reading, that reflect an evolving, twenty-first-century chaotics; I have termed these pulsating subjectivity, mercurial body-text and collective mind. Crucial to this discussion are evolutions in subjectivity in the post-digital age, where bodies and texts have become deeply embedded with, and within, high-tech communication networks. The result is a new horizon of textual strategies and effects that privilege network-ecologies of personhood over individuality and coherence; Exchange Place is a quintessential illustration of this literary horizon.",31,"WOS:000416544100012",3

Drawing upon Jean-Jacques Lecercle's notion of nonsense, this essay is a small attempt to examine three of Dr. Seuss's beginner books-The Cat in the Hat, One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish, and Green Eggs and Ham-along with Mikhail Bakhtin's ideas. It argues that Bakhtin's concepts of chronotope, carnivals and dialogism offer themselves as toolkits to illuminate the nonsensical chronotopes prevalent in Seuss's books, including multiple mini-chronotopes, narratorial voices, and mixing of the everyday and fantasy in a dialogic way. The Seussian world in the three books is read as a collection of nonsensical chronotopes in which everyday scenes are converted into carnivalesque mini-chronotopes, parallel to the real world but having their own logics. The Seussian rhymes are also far from being monologic in nature, but are woven and constructed as a dialogic mode of discourse. Seussian nonsense texts partake in the invention of a genre by demonstrating a radical pedagogy of priming that sees a word more than a concept but also endowed with certain physicality and dialogicity. The nonsensical chronotopes also demonstrate a dialogic demand on readers, inviting them to engage with books, have fun reading, and see the world in an alternative way.",30,"WOS:000415213300003",3

Like several of his counterparts, not only is he black, but he is also alone among his relatives in being so.

This paper concludes that. Abd al-Wahhab's blackness is produced through a set of scientific and speculative discourses that go beyond the prominent theories of climate influences and Hamitic genealogy, and that posit instead a racial determinacy that occurs spontaneously, regardless of geography or lineage, through a variety of interventions from and against the maternal body.

"English",,,"Abraham Fraunce's (1558-1593) The Arcadian Rhetorike went to press as the Armada approached England's shores. Usually studied as a conduit for the circulation of Renaissance poetry, Fraunce was the first to publish excerpts of Sir Philip Sidney's (1554-1586) writing that had circulated previously only in manuscript. This article asks: is Fraunce's excerption of Sidney driven by more than his search for patronage? Is it instead patriotic? The Arcadian Rhetorike's juxtaposition of languages, and particularly English and Spanish poetry, reveals an underlying concern with the nationalist fervor that characterized England in 1588. Rather than a mere pedagogic and at times pedantic manual, The Arcadian Rhetorike may also be propaganda a call to arms advocating for emulation of Spanish verse that, counterintuitively, resists Spain's martial advancements. Printed just two years after England's role in the Netherlands expanded and Fraunce's patron, Sidney, was killed as he fought against the influence of Philip II, The Arcadian Rhetorike signals its relevance to the growing English antipathy for Spain from the moment it invokes the name of Arcadia. Continuity between three seemingly unrelated aspects of The Arcadian Rhetorike reflects upon the tense moment in which it was printed: its publication of Sidney's writing; the passages it excerpts from Garcilaso de la Vega's (1501-1536) poetry; and its apparent reliance on the nationalist edition of Obras de Garci Lasso (1580) of Fernando de Herrera (1534-1597) a patriotic Spanish poet known for his verse celebrating contemporary military leaders. Thus this article will establish Fraunce's political motivations and expand understanding of Sidney's posthumous importance as a political symbol in the developing English conflict with Spain.",33,"WOS:000398883100003",3

In this contribution, van Krevelen's thesis from 2003 is examined in the light of the purchasing policy of the Uitgevers-Maatschappij Elsevier (Publishing Company) founded in 1880. It showed that, up to 1865, the potential market for belle lettres was indeed limited, but fairly predictable. Also, the market for literature was larger than the one for 'light reading'. After 1865, the individual-buyer's market grew steadily, which caused expectations for the potential belle lettres market to rise considerably. However, in the course of the 188os, the capricious and unpredictable nature of the mass market became apparent. Not until the end of the nineteenth century did literature become a marginal activity in the publishing sector, which could only exist on account of internal financing.",21,"WOS:000401494900001",3

This essay examines the relationship of aesthetics and politics in institutionalized creative writing in the Philippines by unpacking the politics of the Silliman Workshop's autonomous aesthetics. It situates the origins, pedagogy, and imagined community of the Silliman Workshop within the network of American colonial education in the Philippines, American cultural diplomacy, and institutionalized creative writing in the United States. It explores how New Criticism, as appropriated by the Iowa Writers' Workshop-trained Tiempos, conflates the autonomy of the literary text with the autonomy of the literary space in which it is produced. The lack of institutional self-critique authorized by this conflation results in the propagation by the Silliman Workshop of colonialist and classist ideas about language and literary production, which are camouflaged, if not naturalized, as principles and mechanisms integral to the craft of writing. The essay calls on the successors of the Tiempos who currently run the Silliman Workshop to scrutinize the historical contingency of the aesthetic values they inherited and to revise their New Critical pedagogy, which continues to uphold the primacy of English as the language of creative writing education and literary production.",68,"WOS:000403875800002",3

Yet Greene composed, some forty years later, in The Scottish History of James the Fourth (c. 1590), a play which overlaps surprisingly with Lyndsay's in both form and content, beginning with a similar deployment of morality-play elements. The common ground includes Greene's allusions to contemporary Scottish social and political problems. Indeed, the evocation by Greene of the triangular play of forces among Scotland, England and France might suggest a virtual rewriting of the Satyre in light of more recent events. The latter would obviously include the 1587 execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, but also the 'Raid of Ruthven' (1582) and the subsequent forced repatriation to France of Esme Stuart (latterly Duke of Lennox), attacked as an arch-flatterer in Reformist polemical texts. At the least, such updated 'Scottish history' emerges with new prominence and greater immediacy when Greene's drama is read alongside Lyndsay's.

Yet, the origins and trajectory of these differences are rarely interrogated by sociologists of culture. Where do ethnic differences in culture come from and why do some persist while others fade? To address these questions, I bring into focus an ethnic group whose cultural distinctiveness is hotly debated in the U.S. but rarely examined by sociologists of culture: Mexican immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants. Using data from the 2002 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts and the Mexican American Study Project II, I measure differences in musical preference between Mexican origin and non-Hispanic black and white Americans, and I test four key mechanisms to account for the ethnic differences I observe: nativity, socioeconomic status, ethnic concentration, and ethnic discrimination. I find that Mexican Americans exhibit a wide array of differences in taste that diminish but still persist after the first generation. While some of these differences are tied to experiences of ethnic isolation and discrimination, the majority are attributable to differences in socioeconomic status. This distinguishes the case of Mexican Americans from that of U.S. blacks, for whom racial disadvantage far outweighs socioeconomic difference in accounting for differences in taste. Genre status also plays a key role in determining where ethnic differences in taste persist and where they fade. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",57,"WOS:000395211700003",3

Films for children and young adults seldom reach a cross-cultural audience, but we contend that this is a consequence of uni-directional globalisation rather than any barriers constituted by the films themselves. In an analysis of narrative conventions and cinematic techniques in film adaptations from China, South Korea and Japan we show that cinematic features enable boundary crossing and ensure childhood experiences are intelligible cross-culturally. These features are broadly of two kinds: elements of narrative, especially global scripts, and cinematic techniques of cognitive and technical kinds. Scripts, whether of general types such as a children's film structure or cause-and-effect structure, or thematic types such as the triumph of the underdog, are widely recognisable. We examine conceptual metaphors, which are intrinsic to human cognition, the visual strategy of emotional mirroring, and film as a metonymic mode which sustains a deeper significance while requiring minimal decoding activity on the part of viewers and promoting mutual understanding between cultures.",18,"WOS:000403469800002",3

The confession of the underground man, the protagonist of Dostoevsky's novel, includes an argument against the Chernyshevskian doctrine of rational egoism. The underground man's argument may, as this article shows, be analyzed using logical truth tables to demonstrate that, however thorough the underground man's argument may appear, it does not consider the counterexample of selfless altruism. This omission prepares the way for the underground man's rejection of Liza at the climax of the second part of the novel. Soseki's novel, too, contains a confession, namely Sensei's testament, in which Sensei relates how he arrived at his belief that humanity is fundamentally selfish. Sensei's style of reasoning is primarily inductive, in contrast with that of other characters in Soseki's novel, and the present article argues that Sensei's style of reasoning is a primary cause of his suicide.

"English",,,"Agatha Christie is so closely associated with the genre of the ""whodunit"" detective novel that her work is often invoked when the genre is defined. According to Tzvetan Todorov's influential essay, ""The Typology of Fiction"" (1966), the generic innovation which often characterises great literature is not appropriate in detective fiction where rigidity of form is intrinsic to the satisfaction the work provides. This is related to the moral function of detective fiction; the identification of the villain and the execution of justice are crucial. It amounts to the expression of an ideology, which according to Michael Green celebrates the individualism of the middle classes and their ability to maintain an ordered society in which they can be psychologically and culturally at home. Christie's only novel set in South Africa, The Man in the Brown Suit (1924) uncharacteristically transgresses these hallowed conventions of the genre. It is my contention that this is the result of autobiographical and personal elements in the work as well as the intrusion of other genres provoked by the novel's (South) African setting. While these elements jeopardise the success of the work as a whodunit, they have also prompted a narrative innovation which has largely been ignored by critics. When successfully subjected to the jealous demands of the genre in a later work by the same author, this innovation produced what has been acclaimed by some as the greatest detective novel of all, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926).",28,"WOS:000398901800001",3

Wood's genetic-cultural study combines critical interpretations of Woolf 's evolving aesthetic practices and political stance with detailed analysis of authorial considerations under the influence of contemporary writing and political climate in the last decade of Woolf's life.",1,"WOS:000416779900004",3

While a number of literary scholars have examined Dirty Girls, none have fully considered Valdes's equally troubling portrayal of another form of consumption: dining. Food is consumed by the characters, or sucias/dirty girls, as they call themselves, in amounts ranging from excessive to minuscule; as I argue, their attitudes about food, eating, and certain dining establishments reflect their complex, troubling expressions of Latina identity. Through an analysis of the novel's treatment of food, dining, and consumption, I examine the characters' troubling Latina identity as they (at times) futilely reject stereotypes of Latina women.",25,"WOS:000414066800010",3

Most critics, he suggests, ""insist upon the story, for the causally and chronologically constructed narrative is generally viewed as central.' One means of moving beyond causation and chronology, we argue, is by recourse to the concept of the plot genotype, first elaborated by Vladimir Propp in his analysis of the Russian fairy tale. In this essay, we show how a refined Proppian morphology can be used to interpret Katherine Mansfield's story 'At ""Lehmann's""' (1910).

This transcendent experience is not ironized in the novel by the author's characteristic discourse of religious doubt. In fact, it exists in the text as a counterweight to the career of the prophet Mahound, who also ascends a mountain with aspirations of transcendence. Allie explains her experience in terms of her deceased father's rejection of the idea of the continuum'. Otto Cone's universe of irreconcilable elements admits the possibility of the sublime without reconciling it with a consistent metaphysical system. In fact, this approach to the sublime may allow a perceiver to regard it in that other (Rudolf) Otto's words as a mysterium tremendum', discontinuous with the path of normal life. The sublime mountain presents not just an obstacle in Allie's life journey but an incoherence; a break in the track. Allie is one of only a few Rushdie characters untroubled by a religious upbringing and yet she is the one who, in her encounter with Everest, experiences transcendence in its naked perfection. This paper explores the paradox of secular transcendence in this novel, noting that Allie's reflections on the topic echo some of the author's own in Is Nothing Sacred?'",26,"WOS:000425102700003",3

Embedded in the top end of the trajectory of human influence on the world, the cities of Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance (1995) and Joseph O'Neill's The Dog (2014) allow for important investigations into the Anthropocene and its origins, into growth and its limits and costs, into the place and participation of cities in the Anthropocene, into questions of despair, and into reasons for hope. One of the assumptions here is that while capitalism is not the cause of the Anthropocene, it is certainly one of the symptoms of the accelerated Anthropocene, a symptom present and inescapable in both A Fine Balance and The Dog. This article argues that there is good cause for hope, since cities are, to date, the most efficient organizations with which we have yet come up.

"English","The Chinese Dream; ideology; cultural interpretation",,"Although many scholars have approached the Chinese Dream from various perspectives, there have been few attempts to explore how Chinese government at different levels visualizes the Chinese Dream in order to transmit its concept including its grand mission of constructing a harmonious society. From the ""Three Represents"" to the ""Harmonious Society,"" Chinese cities have long been fond of clunky political slogans which eventually turn out attractive thematic public service advertising posters around the country. As the Chinese Dream is exclusively associated with what President Xi Jinping talks about China's mission in the 21st century to rejuvenate the great Chinese nation, it is highly political and has been largely mediated in the expression of Chinese national culture. Chinese Dream posters in series titled "" The Chinese Dream, My Dream"" are now spreading urban China, trying to blend both China's glorious tradition and its present achievements of reform and development. In so doing, the government can not only reclaim a linkage with traditional Chinese wisdom of political and ideological governance but seeks a kind of consensus in dream ideology as well so as to discipline the common masses. So politically and ideologically oriented, the dream posters are unexceptionally following the government's efforts to seek solidarity and bureaucratic social management. Since China is huge and not easy to accommodate all from the satisfaction of basic requirements to more sophisticated needs, the evolving Chinese Dream is inevitably plural embodying a belief in values that are more spiritual, and sometimes to the extent of being utopian. It is argued that the greatest challenges China now faces are those of building a set of ""national"" values that can progressively be considered as ""universal"" rather than systematically trampling them to serve selfish interests. This paper will examine closely a cluster of these dream posters to analyze not only their visuality as a role player in transmitting the government's dream ideology but also their far-fetched and unrealistic high sounding spiritual nourishment that may give rise to ideological issues for further consideration.",3,"WOS:000427237600002",3

The last in a series of elegies written over the course of 14 years, Mother's Photograph' suggests that Creeley, like Barthes, experienced the sporadic' temporality of grief and the surprising violence' attached to the photograph's elegiac use. While the series as a whole sheds light on the trajectory of Creeley's work and suggests a significant revision to existing accounts of elegy in mid-century literary history, the final poem speaks to issues of poetics engaged when a volatile genre, the elegy, is forced to account for the wordless revelations of an aesthetic object imbued with the aura of death.

The problem of how to voice this belief without compromising the objective representation of history in his Trauerspiele (mourning plays) led to a strategy of bifurcation: the realistic plot exposition was framed by interpretive Reyen, choruses in which the deeper allegorical meaning of events was explicated. That the Reyen were sung, whereas the rest of the drama was spoken, bespeaks Gryphius's investment in common notions of music as partly spiritual in nature, but in his tragedy Leo Armenius he also appropriated current poetic ideas that identified music's transcendent qualities with pure, nonverbal sound. The employment of a divinely pre-semantic poetic Klangmalerei within the rationally governed structures of verse enabled Gryphius to voice something of the hidden divine hand behind history without compromising the written record. This belief in the power of sound per se to signify higher things would inform later extra-poetic developments, including notions of the sublime and the ineffable in German instrumental music of the Romantic era.",44,"WOS:000395070500004",3

The strong hold of the New Order regime and their residue in the current political system must have something to do with this. Among a few vernacular writers coping with the aftermath of the tragedy but is less discussed as such is Umar Kayam. The four texts analysed in this article, ""Bawuk,"" ""Musim Gugur Kembali ke Connecticut,"" Para Priyayi and Jalan Menikung: Para Priyayi 2, interrogate the complexity of Gestapu victimization and narrative set by the New Order. The texts reflect the failure of the Javanese nobles (priyayi) in revitalizing their role as political leaders in the face of corrupt political system. Instead of resisting the corrupt regime, they play along in the political game to gain personal benefits. The Javanese nobles siding with the oppressed by joining the Communist Party's affiliated organizations are ostracized and marginalized. Despite Kayam's sympathetic representation of some communist figures in his fiction, his general representation of communist ideology is ambivalent. His figuration of communist poets simply as uncritical serfs of ideology, for example, shows his bias towards accepting the New Order cultural narrative. Despite his sympathetic description of those innocently accused of treason following Gestapu 1965, Kayam still portrays communism as an evil and foreign ideology much in the same way that the New Order regime had been narrating it.",21,"WOS:000409131200005",3

It has been variously read as a confessional baring of his soul, denounced for failing to reflect Cibber's ""inner life,"" treated as a ""fabrication of a role"" (with much difference of opinion as to what that role is), and praised for its contribution to our knowledge of theater personnel and management in Cibber's time.

In the generic terms of the time, it is part ""secret history"" and part ""history with a design."" Cibber believes in the cultural importance of theater, and in its potential force for moral good. He documents the rising social and economic status of actors and presents a case for ""Good Practice"" in management and regulation. Why then open with outrageously provocative flaunting of his pseudo-Foppingtonian self? I suggest that Cibber knew the book would be attacked by Fielding, Pope, and a host of others. So he created a diversionary target which duly got savaged from all sides. The history that was his real point turns out to be remarkably accurate insofar as it is checkable.

It applies the concept of a social mind to descriptions of crowd behavior in Walter Scott's Heart of Midlothian, Thomas Macaulay's History of England, and Charles Dickens's Barnaby Budge. In particular, it examines the behavior of crowds as a whole, individuals (especially leaders), and subgroups in terms of the key notions of agency, moral responsibility, organization, and action. Finally, it places this debate within the context of nineteenth-century historiography to explore potential differences between fictional and historiographical treatments of crowds. It concludes that, while histories tend to be pragmatically inclined to treat crowds as social minds, the distinctive affordances of fiction allowed nineteenth-century novelists to be more flexible and to choose either to treat crowds as social minds where appropriate or, as Dickens did in Barnaby Budge, to complicate or undermine this notion.",15,"WOS:000410253600006",3

The model of narration and scripting of reading practices in the Cecile and Marie-Grace stories promote cross-racial identification, showing how, because children read from already racialized perspectives that literature also informs, both black and white children might benefit from seeing alternating perspectives of slavery represented.

For Marvell, in contrast, the value of lyric resides in the ways in which it challenges the dialectical notion of creative destruction and, instead, conceives of an annihilation that does not transform into its more respectable opposite.

In The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman (1972), Carter suggests that the Romantic ideals of harmony and transcendence limit personal freedom, and that the Romantic imagination is not as liberating as its champions claim. This is illustrated through the protagonist Desiderio, whose fragmented sense of self arises from his liminal position as a mixed-race inhabitant of a postcolonial nation. His yearning for a clear identity is characteristic of the Romantic desire for a lost harmony, but Carter criticizes this European philosophy for its potential to mythologize a dangerous formof self-sacrifice.

My main aim is to demonstrate that, through this hybrid figure (German, Jewish, Indian), along with the circular structure of the novel and the repetitive use of images and metaphors evoking Otherness and alienation which this analysis discloses, Desai deploys the multidirectional model of memory, defined by Michael Rothberg as the overlap of individual and collective traumatic memories of different nations at different times. I conclude that Desai's work exemplifies the way individual and collective Holocaust memories may be transposed to divergent traumatic events and conflicts, like those of the Partition and the British internment camps in India.

The significance of the illness is a burden metaphor in Old English is greater than in Present Day English, in which, as pointed out by Goddard and Wierzbicka (2014) it would not be usual to speak of a heavy illness. The paper also investigates whether there is evidence for a nascent form of the military metaphor for illness and medicine, as identified by Sontag (1978/1991) and exemplified in Middle English by Diaz-Vera (2009). The military metaphor suggests a different approach to illness, in which one 'fights' the affliction. This is not well-evidenced in Old English, and it is argued in this paper that these two conceptual metaphors are based on distinct cultural schemas (Quinn 1987). While illness is a burden is to an extent grounded in embodied experience (Lakoff and Johnson 1999), the conceptualisation in Old English cannot fully be understood without also taking into account cultural schemas influenced by the humoral theory of disease aetiology, and by the religious context.",36,"WOS:000410900700007",3

Rather than treating these features as independently assigned, Bourdieu argues they are different manifestations of the same latent positional and dispositional spaces in the field from which new cultural objects emerge. Using a new dataset on the full population of submissions to the Booker Prize for Fiction over nine years (N = 1094), we rely on a suite of characteristics across these three areas of foci to examine the latent positions in the field through which ""art"" is defined and consecrated. Findings show the consecration process begins with publishers' nominations, which reflect a relational field of competing positions occupied by different groups under the canopy of the former British Empire. Afterward, juries' decisions of shortlisters and then winners reveal how consecration emerges through a distancing from England-centered voices, followed by a growing preference for legitimation by the literary establishment, and male over female voices.

His famous preface to the collection instructs the reader to combine two modes of reading: one that is fluid and aims at emotional involvement, and another that is repetitive, meticulous, and focused on detail. These blended modes of reading, Tieck claims, yield enriched aesthetic effects and lend the anthology artwork status. His editing practices support this poetics of reading. The material features of the anthology as print medium (typeface, page layout, etc.) increase the reading flow, yet at the same time Tieck's translations from medieval into modern German contain moments of resistance that keep the reader attentive.

"English",,,"As part of their commitment to topicality, one of the fundamental premises of the Victorian illustrated press, The Graphic (1869-1932) and The Illustrated London News (1842-2003) devoted significant space to the representation of urban poverty. At a time when the discussions around the extension of the franchise provided a tribune for latent tensions between bourgeois power and working-class rise, citizenship came to be defined in terms of social and cultural identities, prompting an exclusive discourse which pervaded the whole political spectrum. Concentrating on a selection of illustrations published between the mid-1860s to the late 1870s, this article purports to examine the way in which this exclusive discourse was articulated by the Illustrated London News and the Graphic, illuminating the conflict between the newspapers' stated aim of providing a truthful record of everyday events and the images produced. Its central assertion is that the artistic, satirical and technical filters used by the draughtsmen in these representations helped to establish a distinction between ""deserving"" and ""undeserving"" poverty. By drawing a literal line between suitable and unsuitable citizens, these periodicals articulated a reassuring visual discourse relying on a shared set of assumptions between artists, editors and readers about what the political nation should become.",55,"WOS:000446169000002",3

In the origination of this film, the orthodoxy of conventional development processes was not challenged despite the narrative being an exploration of a challenging subject, that of a married M (a) over bar ori man struggling to reveal and come to terms with his lifelong gay identity in a tribal-based society where many reject such identification. In unravelling the decision-making behind the film's development, I suggest that the decision to take a conservative path in storytelling, while arguably doing a disservice to the autobiographical novel on which the film was based, nevertheless achieved the intentions of the producers, who saw in the story an opportunity to speak to non-indigenous New Zealanders about the reality of modern middle-class M (a) over bar ori lives.

In the media, a set of 'stock' radicalisation narratives have emerged in which, typically, a misguided loner is brainwashed into embracing a violent perversion of Islam. In the background, the wider Muslim community is accused of a dangerous complicity and complacency. This essay explores some notable attempts in fiction to unpick such popular radicalisation narratives. In novels by John Updike and Sunjeev Sahota, the psychological and faith dimensions of suicide bombing are a key focus, attempting to explore from the inside, how an educated young Muslim might be impelled along the path to martyrdom. In texts by Mohsin Hamid and J.M. Coetzee, the ideological staging of 'radicalisation' and 'fundamentalism' themselves is brought into question. Current counterterrorist measures include indefinite detention of US citizens without trial, while in the UK, over two million public sector workers have been recruited to the largest surveillance exercise ever codified in British law.

This article argues that the revival of the anagram in France and its introduction to England in the 1560s by Charles Utenhove resulted in an aversion to the form for the rest of Elizabeth's reign. The French anagram was associated with cabalistic ideas which define by contrast a plain-speaking 'Englishness' in writers such as Nashe and John Harvey (Puttenham's account of the anagram is taken to refer to the 1560s). An attempt is made to discuss all known uses before 1603 of the word 'anagram' and its cognates. The anagram did know some success when it was introduced in Scotland in the 1590s; when James succeeded Elizabeth in England, it became respectable there too.

Situated within the framework of Derridean thought on hospitality, this article examines Dulce Maria Cardoso's O Retorno (The return, 2011) and Isabela Figueiredo's Caderno de Memorias Coloniais (Notebook of colonial memories, 2009) with a focus on the return to the metropolitan centre or Metropole - actually ""repatriation"" from former Portuguese African colonies to Portugal - and the subsequent estrangement and negotiation of inhospitality and hostility experienced by Cardoso's and Figueiredo's characters. If travel and migration in themselves present an identitary challenge, in the sense that the encounter with the other coincides with the reconfiguration of self, the issues of gender and a forced return ""home"" add complexity to this challenge.

However, a careful analysis of her essays allows us to trace cornerstones of her aesthetics, which-though not amounting to a rigid formal framework-are surprisingly coherent. While her ideas about ""the art of writing"" developed throughout her lifetime, and although the emphasis shifts, it is possible to identify some major aesthetic principles upon which she elaborated in only a handful of theoretical essays, but which nonetheless underpin both the practice and the theory of her literary criticism. Examining the connections between Woolf's beliefs about aesthetics, it becomes possible to place her thoughts about modernist modes of writing in the context of her overarching framework of ideas concerning literature and literary change. For Woolf, writing was a method of communication, and some key characteristics of her aesthetics include writers' visions, formal unity, impersonality and the cultural embedding of literature. Considering not only cultural circumstances but also readers' expectations as possible obstacles that can distract writers and impair their work, Woolf wrote hundreds of essays trying to convey her ideas about the ""art of writing"" to common readers.",47,"WOS:000422841500013",3

Drawing from musical modalities of expression, both plays carry the project of destruction of language and extinction of narrative apparatus to a new level. Music is essentially brought about by the paring down of words, the precise timing of pauses or silences, and the shaping of sounds into an elaborate musical patterning of themes and variations.

The analysis is supported by a set of readings of other poems from Les Fleurs du Mal, along with the poem's allusions not only to Athalie but also to the Bible. 'Les M,tamorphoses du Vampire' enacts a scene of divine punishment for both blasphemy and fornication, yet as this punishment is visited on the vampire, the poet loses the text.

By reviewing the manuscripts submitted to the Office of the Lord Chamberlain, our article proposes to examine the approaches that made it possible for London directors and producers to edit light comedies which, with the name Feydeau, boasted of their French origin and frivolous nature, even when this choice carried inevitable risks. How could they avoid offending a Lord Chamberlain, hostile to any signs of immorality, with these plays, which were often based on subversive and ribald comedy? In each case, the manuscripts submitted for his censorship, in the proposed texts, reveal a prior self-censorship, evident both in the choices of the plays presented, and in the contortions of the adapters and translators: transpositions of situations, cuts and line changes all aimed at smoothing over or toning down the comedic effects relating to sexuality, as well as to social divisions. Even the most faithful translations brought about a shift in the starting situation, profoundly changing Feydeau's reflections on intimate relationships and social ties. But why edit these plays, and deliberately run into such obstacles? Perhaps the dramatic and rhythmic inventiveness of Feydeau's plays was an irresistible attraction to both performers and the public, as the study of their reception reveals.

"English",,,"Buenos Aires had already passed its brief heyday as a Yiddish publishing center when the journalist, Yiddishist, communist, literary scholar, and teacher Mimi Pinzon (1910-1975) published her autobiographical novel, Der hoyf on fentster (The Courtyard without Windows; 1965). The novel tells an immigrant coming-of-age story set in a conventillo (Argentine tenement). Central to the novel's action-and politics-is the conventillo's hoyf, or courtyard, a space of radical, multilingual possibility that stands in contrast to the often brutal repression-psychological and physical-of the monolingual state. In Yiddish, the novel crafts a miniature, multilingual Argentina that finds its ""nationhood"" in loose networks of humane solidarity. I argue that Pinzon's choice to articulate this radical linguistic vision in a language that would soon be inaccessible to all but a handful of readers-her insistence on minor language maintenance, her willingness to risk noncirculation-models an expansive vision of world literature that broadens our understanding of this concept.",30,"WOS:000419357700007",3

"English","Mary Shelley; The Last Man; sympathy; intimacy; interpersonal relations",,"Building on recent scholarship that explores Mary Shelley's advocacy for sympathy in The Last Man (1826), this essay traces the complexity of interpersonal and reader-text relations as they play out in the novel and in the experience of reading it. I argue that moments of intimacy explicitly called ""sympathy"" in the novel are often idealizations that turn ""revolting"" as sympathy becomes something other than the beneficial exchange that participants expect of it. These scenes delineate a politics of sympathy that challenges the dominant model with a portrayal of human intimacy as uncontrollable, amoral, and infectious. Shelley encodes in the novel's infamous plague her concern that the experience of sympathy that underlies nineteenth-century politics of community-and nation-formation can and sometimes does generate violence, discord, and inequality alongside mutually beneficial relationships. Exploring readers' uncertain responses to the novel alongside the novel's representation of sympathy as revolting, I suggest that the novel's framing ""Introduction"" reveals an aesthetics of sympathy in which reader-text relations are constitutively unstable. Readers' resistance to Lionel's effusive narration is a revolting response written into the novel's sympathetic design. By making sympathetic reading a revolting experience, Shelley advances a revision of sympathy that forces us to rethink the possibilities and the consequences of human relationships and invites us to reimagine a communal future that makes room for those realities.",31,"WOS:000411777000001",3

In keeping with those values, historical and visual analogies (rhymes) abound in the Resistance poetry of Aragon's Musee Grevin (1943), whose title foretells fascist leaders' derisory future as immobile, waxen afterimages. Its central poem, by casting Hitler as Goethe's Sorcerer's Apprentice, depicts language's power to enchant or immobilize. Furthermore, Aragon's poem itself develops an illusion of imprecatory power exerted over the Fuhrer. It does so, I argue, by engaging with readers' memory for sound, idiom, and history. Rhymes and familiar fixed expressions lend inexorability to the poet's pronouncements. And by rhyming historical circumstances (downfallen autocrats) with contemporary circumstances (fascists in power), Aragon prophesies the pattern's logical, inevitable conclusion: the fascists' downfall.",25,"WOS:000409195400001",3
"English","Bulgarian literature; Bulgarian National Revival; Liberation; Romanticism; national mythology",,"Bulgarian literature of the 19th century, although widely unknown abroad, is decisive for the formation of Bulgarian national identity. In this respect, the authority of the 'national poet' Hristo Botev has been uncontested for 140 years. Botev has created the Bulgarian mytho-poetic narrative and imposed it as a set of political, social and ethical principles, crystalized to a corrective. Yet, Botev's poetic agenda is contradictory. His nationalism, based on natural belonging to the people, kin and family, is persistently extended towards social criticism and a utopian longing for class equality. Thus, the prior national unity appears subverted: the representatives of the elite are stigmatized as non-belonging to the nation per se, to 'the people,' a collective subject, enslaved, suffering, passive, and mute. Such an irresolvable contradiction between the two struggles - for national liberation and for social emancipation - is additionally complicated by Botev's third, most intimate longing - for personal unbinding that would take the radical form of self-emerging beyond any kinship and class affiliation. Thus, the mytho-poetic figure of an apocalyptic Motherland had to be re-articulated as the eternal 'There' of a coveted death. Finally, Botev's self-victimization, orchestrated as a rebel raid, is his response to the fallen heroes and their failed sacrifice. Bulgaria's most powerful national poet gave birth to a national myth of the genius who voluntarily gave up poetry and joined the masses by embracing their role of a victim.",27,"WOS:000403818800004",3

While the fantasy of an aeviternally permanent nature is a comforting one for Lucy Swithin, this inherently conservative temporal fiction carries a troubling politics, and is deeply problematic from various perspectives. It threatens to petrify exploitative gender, colonial and class relations in a changeless nature, with no prospect of emancipatory historical change.

"English","Antony and Cleopatra; foreignness; idleness; labour; law",,"By evoking the implications of an unlawful race, this article draws attention to Cleopatra's association with a marginalised, volatile, and criminalised group: early modern gypsies. What do anxieties about the group's seditiousness - sexual and social - reveal about references to Cleopatra as a gypsy? What social appraisals and economic motives underpin early modern critiques of gypsies, informing Antony's remorse that a right gypsy hath at fast and loose / Beguiled me to the very heart of loss (4.13.28-29)? The condemnation of gypsies, codified in social documents and royal edicts circulating in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, signals a local experience of the alien within one's borders. As such, Shakespeare's depiction of the Egyptian queen uniquely represents Cleopatra as a racialised figure of transnational and local significance. In developing the ways gypsies inform Shakespeare's construction of Cleopatra's foreignness, I also investigate the cultural representations mitigating the status and assessment of gypsies in early modern England. Ultimately, Shakespeare's Cleopatra manifests gypsies' refusal to heed, and performs the ways they threaten, industrious occupations. Far from simply decrying a vagrant population as a social nuisance, England's preoccupation with gypsies turns into a racially marked discourse, villainising an alternative way of life that resists the state's absorption of the surplus value of legitimate labour and rejects the social obligations essential to reproducing the principles and priorities of the commonwealth.",32,"WOS:000405718900003",3

Although his ideology was reactionary, aspects of his poetics were radical and progressive. In fact, he himself derived many of his tropes from earlier writers whose worldviews differed radically from his - the topoi were not formed by his ideology.

To further the senseless world evoked in the play, Lagarce also adds a soundtrack with fake laughter inspired by sitcoms. Then, when Vincent Bataillon films Lagarce's production in 2007, he relays the textual and scenic readings of the absurd on the screen with cinematic devices.

This article explores the trajectory of Caribbean spaces and Anglophone world literatures as a matter of migration and circulation, but also in terms of the symbolic translation by which experiences of movement and space are aesthetically mediated. Because of its global span across different locations Caribbean writing in English is constituted as world literature almost by definition.

In this essay, I focus on the volume of fictionalized biographies Foreigners:Three English Lives (2007) to demonstrate that polyphony in Phillips' work resides not only in the structural confrontation of characters' and narrators' voices but also in the subtle inscription of the implied author's subjectivity within his texts. Borrowing methods from the discipline of stylistics, I first establish through a focus on the use of adjectives and modality (that is, grammatical means indicating how speakers position themselves in relation to propositions) in the opening section of Foreigners, ""Dr Johnson's Watch,"" how the first-person narrator gradually transitions from tentativeness to self-confidence. This change enables the implied author, on the one hand, to expose the thwarted logic of the colonially tinted discourse of his eighteenth-century narrator and, on the other, to reflect on the process of ideological encoding inherent in the writing of historiography. Such an investigation based on modality further allows me to challenge the critical consensus that the second section of the book, ""Made in Wales,"" is a straightforward factual account. I suggest that the story of the rise and fall of mixed-race boxer Randolph Turpin is in fact a highly polyphonic narrative that features increasingly marked clashes in modality and point of view. These clashes, I argue,draw attention to the construction of historiographical discourse deceptively made to appeal' so commonsense by the narrator of ""Dr Johnson's Watch.""",49,"WOS:000415665400009",3

The love of the title and that it is in a wood, or confused, points to this issue of a subversion of the meaningful by the meaningless.

Despite the recent work on Victorian hand studies, little attention has been paid to such moments when characters' hands touch. This essay introduces the term ""manual intercourse"" as a way of referring to all literary depictions of tactile encounters (whether handshakes, caresses, uninvited grasps, or other accidental manual interactions) while acknowledging the silent, embodied communication and exchange inherent in such moments of physical connection. Taking Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848) as an example par excellence, this essay explores how reading a novel through characters' manual intercourse opens new ways of understanding and interpreting intense moments of emotional intimacy that language fails to represent adequately. Since emotions can be communicated through the quality, pressure, duration, and circumstance of a touch, manual intercourse in such novels allows for the possibility of excess sentiment that cannot be simply expressed through speech. Further, though nineteenth-century etiquette books dedicated entire sections to delineating types of handshakes acceptable in certain social situations, this essay suggests that some Victorian novelists challenged traditional gender ideology and the power structures inherent in it through representations of manual intercourse that either adhere to or deviate from traditional handshake etiquette.",62,"WOS:000411777000002",3

"English","Fechter (Charles); Hamlet; melodrama; Princess's Theatre; acting technique",,"Charles Fechter (1824-1879) was known by many of his mid-century admirers as the best lover on the London stage. According to the majority of his biographers the actor was London-born, but of French extraction and raised for the most part in France. He began his stage career in Paris, first achieving success in amateur circles before joining the Comedie Francaise. Having taught himself more or less fluent English, he returned to London in 1860, performing at the Princess's before taking over the lease of the Lyceum in 1862. Over the next decade he alternated between London and Parisian appearances, before sailing for America. Though he first came to English prominence in legitimate drama-primarily for his unconventional Hamlet in 1861-Fechter's particular style was deemed to be more suited to mid-century melodrama. The American critic Henry Austin Clapp describes him as 'a master of the exterior symbolism of the histrionic art', and the actor's own annotations to his acting copy of Othello reflect the focus he placed on the development of his character through gesture, posture, movement, and other superficial markers. Although this external focus was perfectly suited to the mid-century melodramatic stage, Fechter's French mannerisms, and particularly the accent and intonations he was unable (or unwilling) to erase entirely, divided the London audiences and critics. Anticipating Clapp's scathing dissection of his pronunciation of particular words and the want of taste shown in the later American audiences who accepted him, some English commentators reacted to the actor's choices as specifically (and unnecessarily) French, and as unsuited to the London stage. Others either dismissed the accent and mannerisms altogether, ignoring Fechter's nationality to assess both positively and negatively his basic skills as an actor, or saw the particularly French aspects of his representations as adding to the actor's broader appeal. Foremost among the latter group was Charles Dickens, who saw and admired Fechter's Hamlet and quickly added the Frenchman to his group of actor-companions. Many studies have looked at the temporary star turns taken by French actors in London, with the performances of, for example, Sarah Bernhardt and Rachel coming in for a particularly large amount of analysis. Fechter, however, who chose to work alternately in Paris and in London and who performed in both French and English, has escaped this focus. Using published reviews, letters, and the plays in which he appeared-including Fechter's own adaptations and his annotated Othello-I propose to examine how this often overlooked actor was both received as the London stage's greatest lover and at the same time considered particularly French, and how this seeming contradiction reflects contemporary London theatre-goers' divergent reactions to anything French on their stages.",30,"WOS:000422974900008",3

The recent critical turn to 'surface reading' has been met with a renewed interest in literary depth, as manifested in emerging critical discourses around oceanic studies and blue ecology; in this context it argues that the much-remarked presence of seas and seafarers in Maximus should be thought of as operating beyond the merely thematic level. It tracks the development of an oceanic and depth-based poetics through Olson's thinking and writing, from his earliest critical work on Melville though to the latter sections of Maximus, eliciting in the process a new framework for reading the long poem's scale.",35,"WOS:000424921900006",3
"English","Charlotte Bronte; cultural criticism; desire; Fanny Fern; gender; liminality; nineteenth-century transatlantic literature; space; subjectivity","FICTION","Charlotte Bronte in Jane Eyre (1847) and Fanny Fern in Ruth Hall (1855) inscribe the possibility for personal agency through textual passages that describe border spaces and movement between margin and periphery, inside and outside, and departure and arrival. The authors employ architectural portals windows, doorways, gates, stairs and hallways to illuminate an array of physical, psychic and socio-cultural spaces and to convey a more fluid sense of truth as knowledge gained by experience. Truth is represented within a subjective lens, in the different positions their protagonists assume. By way of the insertion of autobiographic resonances in their fiction, Charlotte Bronte and Fanny Fern invert public and private spheres, thereby creating a strategy for personal agency. This emphasis on mobile independence for a woman did not sit well with many nineteenth-century critics, who responded adversely to the implied expansion of gender roles. Ultimately, Charlotte Bronte and Fern, through their method of encoding threshold images with subjective significance, create a conceptual space that affords possibilities of resistance to social oppression.",23,"WOS:000396035700007",3

Her unabashedly mundane and pedantic literary style embodies a self-consciously modern aesthetics of didacticism that pervaded US literature in its years of transition between realism, naturalism, and modernism and that characterized the subgenre of sociological fiction. Gilman's 1910 novel What Diantha Did models the social rigor that sociological novelists considered essential to the art of fiction. What Diantha Did tracks the creation of a system of kitchenless homes in California and the subsequent emancipation of women from forced domesticity. Gilman's prose reflects on, and even formally replicates, the drudgery and repetition she associates with household labor. Gilman proposes an analogy between novels and kitchens as genres of modern social life: both must be collectivized and liberated from the archaic, the personal, and the masculine.",54,"WOS:000414769500003",3

The Degenerate Art Exhibition of 1937-1938 was an important source for Salomon's innovative mixture of word and image. Where the Degenerate Art Exhibition's text served to label, vilify, condemn and erase, Salomon's use of text emphasizes ambiguity, not fixity. It layers the art rather than effacing it. Most importantly, it rejects the Nazi attack on Jewish German artists and people by reclaiming both art and language. Salomon's creation of a kunstlerroman soon after The Nazis' display of repression and purgation defied the Kunst politik of the regime.

"English",,,"Chenjerai Hove is one of the most prolific writers in Zimbabwe in the English language. Hove has written novels, poetry and some critical essays. He has also written in the Shona language. Although, Hove's creative ouvre has received some important critical evaluation, most of these evaluations are on his novels. However, recently, critics have taken an interest in Hove's poetic works. In 2009, Chenjerai Hove completed a collection of poems called Love and Other Ghosts (2009) which has remained unpublished to date. Sadly, Hove passed away on the 12th of July, 2015 while on self-imposed exile in Norway. This article is a tribute to Hove's poetic ingenuity and an exploration of the poetic shift registered in Hove's poetic creativity from poetry that defines itself as committed to issues of social justice and whose contradictions would be openly resolved through armed, class and gender struggles towards poetry that celebrates life through the trope of love. In Love and Other Ghosts (2009), the poet's voice appears less critical of bad governance as is openly registered in his Blind Moon (2003). This article argues that the subversive power of Love and Other Ghosts (2009) is precisely its refusal to conceive of protest politics in terms of slogans against the ruling elites as one can see in Palaver Finish (2002). Instead, in Love and Other Ghosts, Hove carves out an alternative site where contradictory voices temper with official narratives of Zimbabwe's post-independence dispensation. Hove's Love and Other Ghosts (2009) creates its own fictional and poetic context that shows that even in the most hostile circumstances, ordinary people can still organise their lives around those values that are life-sustaining. Instead of merely protesting against betrayal of the masses, Love and Other Ghosts affirms the inevitability of change through the archetypal image of love.",21,"WOS:000405334200007",3

Recent historical studies of marginalia created by older children, those who have mastered conventional writing and drawing, have challenged this notion by looking at extratextual annotations as a means to understanding children's diverse uses of books as both intellectual and physical objects. However, pre-conventional scribbles on books by very young children have not been explored as artifacts of emergent literacy practices or reader response. Yet, scholarship in the fields of literacy education, art education, early childhood education and theories of place suggest that children can develop expectations for books in the first few years of life and that their earliest drawing experiences show evidence of intentionality. This reader response study draws from video data of three-year-old Elijah and his eighteen-month-old sister, Hannah, to explore the production, of pre-conventional marginalia in early childhood. The findings of this study suggest that toddlers and preschool-aged children can understand books as distinct and pleasurable artifacts in their immediate environments, that the marks they make in their picturebooks are evidence of reader response, that the act of drawing enables them to engage in a fictional landscape, and that pre-conventional marginalia can provide us with insight into very young children's earliest aesthetic responses to texts.",34,"WOS:000401423100003",3

This gap concerns how the place of children - especially girls and notions of girlhood - has changed over time in texts and cultural productions around the traditions of recitation and minstrelsy. 1 Robin Bernstein has argued persuasively that the 'scripts' of a racist past inform the cultural constructions of the present and that children's material and popular culture is often its repository: 'Sentimentalism or minstrelsy may have peaked in the lives of adults in the nineteenth century, but the popular cultures of childhood ... delivered, in fragmented and distorted forms, the images, practices, and ideologies of sentimentalism and minstrelsy well into the twentieth century' (7).

However, those categories are connected by the sublime, a quantum state that can collapse into either awe or horror. I will discuss the exception to this rigorous division, namely the Kefahuchi Tract, the central mystery in M. John Harrison's Empty Space trilogy. Many instances of Tract activity follow the conventions of a classic haunting. Still, the Tract is characterised as essentially Weird. I will present several ways of reading the Tract. Firstly, stressing the 'science' in science fiction, as a black hole without an event horizon, affecting all of reality and preserving old data. Secondly, as a literary phenomenon, a psychological journey. Both approaches are equally valid since the Tract is presented as a quantum phenomenon. It exists in an entangled intermediate state, and only the reader's interpretation creates one fixed meaning. Moreover, recurring markers in the texts point towards each narrative's being embedded in an overarching theme that connects most of Harrison's fiction, which is the notion of secondary-world fantasy literature as escapism - presented in a way that is clearly anti-escapist.",44,"WOS:000410830500007",3

Cities are so deeply textured, and so continually scattered by the circulations of their component parts, that we cannot perceive them as a whole; the borders we use to define them are ultimately arbitrary. I argue that this perceptual disorientation, or aesthetic crisis, embodies the politics of the novel. Mieville depicts the continuous crises of urban existence chemical spills, refugees seeking asylum, even a weed growing in the wrong place as so many possibilities for metonymically grasping the larger ontological and political reality. Crisis does not entail a specific political (or artistic) response, however, since it can traumatize into complacency and xenophobia just as easily as expand one's commitments. The same kind of aesthetic crisis is provoked by the novel itself, because it frustrates expectations and eludes a clear genre, and readers can respond in analogous ways: with the urge to impose allegorical meaning and genre borders, or with a more refined perceptual sense. Thus, the form of the novel cleverly reflects its content and, in both cases, we are pushed to renew our sense of wonder at the strange alterity that inheres in the familiar and proximal.",33,"WOS:000417475000012",3
"English",,"OLD-ENGLISH 'CHRIST-AND-SATAN'; 'BEOWULF'","Christ and Satan, the final poem in the Junius Manuscript, is often viewed as an outlier because it lacks illustrations and shows overt signs of wear and tear. Moreover, the poem follows an unorthodox chronology in that it places the Harrowing, Ascension, and Last Judgement before Christ's Temptation in the wilderness, leading scholars to characterize Christ and Satan as 'meandering' at best. Beyond this, no scriptural, apocryphal, or exegetical source has been identified for the final episode in which Christ orders Satan to measure the 'ymbhwyrft' ('circuit') of hell with his hands. A liturgical reading can reconcile some of Christ and Satan's perceived structural and chronological incongruities. In this way, the poem's conclusion can be productively understood as an inversion of the penitential and spatial rituals associated with Rogationtide, making Satan's punishment a demonic parody of the communal 'circuit' which lies at the centre of the feast. Rogationtide brought together clergy and laity in public practices that involved fasting, vigils, prayers and, most significantly, processions throughout the countryside. By evoking the symbolic geography of Rogationtide, the poet dramatizes Satan's sinfulness through the logic of the feast and challenges his audience to 'beat the bounds' of their earthly community so that they will not wander lordless after Judgement Day.",85,"WOS:000397153500001",3

In this article I trace how signs of Cinna's political ambition are embedded in the text and consider the degree to which it is recognized by the other characters and even by himself. Cinna's ambition is not a constant in the play, but rather decreases in the second half, as the onstage space is dominated more and more by Auguste.

The stern Stasi officer in charge of the surveillance of a playwright and his actress partner comes to play the part of a selfless savior, while the victimized actress becomes a betrayer. Her shame however, is not shared by the playwright, Dreyman, and the Stasi officer, Wiesler, who never meet eye to eye but instead become linked in a mutual gratitude centering on the book dedicated to Wiesler, written years later when Dreyman learns of the other's having subversively protected him from imprisonment.

"English","Ralph Waldo Emerson; plagiarism; context; historicism; economics",,"Context has long been a critical determiner of methodologies for literary studies, granting scholars the tools to make objective claims about a text's political or economic relation to the situation of its genesis. This essay argues that Ralph Waldo Emerson anticipatively criticizes our commitment to such practices through his use of plagiarism a literary mode that exemplifies the denial of the sovereignty of context. I focus on two core principles that underlie Emerson's conception of literature's civic role in Essays: Second Series (1844): first, that literature is driven by an impulse to decontextualize; second, that this means that it has a deep affinity with the deterritorializing logic of capital. Provocatively proposing Emerson as a theorist of the relation between literature and economics, I argue that Essays: Second Series shows how the literary text can negotiate its ineluctable culpability with capitalism, but this does not mean that it can presume to possess a privileged point of vantage that might deny such culpability. Given that this is precisely what much historicizing or contextualizing scholarship implies, I contend that Emerson gives us a case study in the limits of literature and criticism's economic agency.",45,"WOS:000404083200002",3
"English",,,"Contrary to an influential critical tradition that detaches Jane Austen and her style from the body, I argue that Persuasion (1817) represents the culmination of a style in which language is a physical agent, with force that comes from or acts on the body. Embodied language was always part of Austen's aesthetics, appearing in the juvenilia, when the movement of narrative creates the sensation of bodily motion, and in Emma (1815) through physical word games with children's alphabet blocks. In Persuasion, Austen advances the sense of embodied language from her earlier work to language as sensory immersion, particularly through the sensation of words as sounds. With the sense of physical presence and voice that Captain Wentworth's letter imparts, the novel finally reveals a language based on the restoration of the body and its sounds to writing. For Austen, language always gets physical, and her style centres on an emphatic enjoyment of embodied life.",0,"WOS:000419444400005",3

Published in Damascus in 1939 by Muhammad Mustafa Ghandur from Acre, this work of fiction remained in oblivion for decades because the French Mandate authorities confiscated most of its copies soon after publication. It narrates the story of a young physician who forms an armed band to avenge the rape of his younger sister by British soldiers during the 1936-1939 uprising in Palestine; the woman, disguised as a man, joins the rebels and eventually dies in a fight. Through the symbolism behind the retaliation for the maiden's rape, Tha'r al-damm provides a literary interpretation of the Palestinians' shift to organized insurgency against the British Mandate in the late 1930s. By pivoting the plot around the tropes of injury and revenge, Ghandur translated the feelings of humiliation and threat, and the consequent quest for revenge and liberation shared by many Palestinians into a novel. The action of this story takes place in the Palestinian countryside, in a village community portrayed as a spotless model of national solidarity and harmoniously merged with its environment. Ghandur sketches a protagonist who exemplifies the theme of the political radicalization of modern-educated youth and argues for the leading role that they should assume in the struggle, while the only female character illustrates village women's actual involvement in the revolt.",111,"WOS:000416558100002",3

Coetzee's novel Disgrace explores how competing past and present claims of victimization may be reconciled. While critics generally remark on the inability of existing legal frameworks to adequately address the way in which experience is shaped by identity, few have remarked on the temporal dimension of postapartheid South African social relations. This essay considers the way in which temporality modifies and undermines the role of identity claims in contemporary frameworks of justice. It argues that historical injury must be understood not as belonging to identity but as mediated by the temporality of embodied experience. By recognizing historical injury not as static object but as lived affective orientation toward the present, this essay suggests we might create a productive opening for rethinking existing social justice paradigms.",34,"WOS:000400008800006",3

The topic of McCarthy's religio-philosophical concerns is broad and deep and invites further inquiry.

This article casts new light on Self by showing that he may be read as an embodiment of positivism. Self's inability to think speculatively and creatively; his eschewal of moral responsibility in his relationships with others, combined with the materiality of his desires and concerns, shows that he is very much a product of positivism - an outlook that is intimately supportive of, and championed by, classical and late capitalism. This article begins with an exploration of the ways in which positivism is fostered in capitalist societies. It then moves on to a consideration of those aspects of Self's personality - namely his intolerance of difference, respect for hierarchy and order, and his trust in the reality of money - that cannot be assimilated into a postmodern reading, and that intimate a positivist outlook. Finally, the article explores the two facets of his personality that are the most conspicuous tokens of his positivism and which he also struggles against - with the aid of Martina Twain - in a bid to recover a stable life: his paucity of emotional feeling for others and his inability to interpret or think speculatively.",22,"WOS:000414182300001",3

I investigate this influential cross-cultural adaptation in three crucial writers linked to the Beat tradition: Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, and Tom Robbins.

Shakespeare's engagement with Plautus has been well established, but typically identified with his early plays. Amphitryo, which dramatizes the emotional suffering of a pregnant wife wrongfully accused of adultery, haunted Shakespeare's dramatic imagination, especially as a model for intermingling tragic and comic modes. In revisiting the play's juxtaposition of pregnancy, unjust accusations, divine intervention, and miraculous reconciliation, The Winter's Tale similarly explores the tragicomic potential of the fertile female body.

Contemporary critical receptions of Rachilde diminished her authorial agency by using biological models that relied on hopelessly shifting analogies between man, woman, and beast. The novel's narrative of bestial desire between girl and cat plays on this unstable analogical structure to restore a capacity for language, desire, and creative transgression to both the heroine and her stray lover, whose violent entanglement avoids capture by the masculine discourse that seeks to put it in a proper place an allegory for the power of evolutionary complexity to escape the systematizing impulse of post-Darwinian natural science.",40,"WOS:000412613200006",3

Critics of ""Procession"" discount a lot from its richness in mythological and ritual forms but focus more on its topical, social and political nature. The trend in the criticism of the sequence is obviously informed by the historical and political context of the sequence and its inclusion in A Shuttle in the Crypt (1972), a collection on Soyinka's prison experience. This approach to ""Procession"" detracts from the art in the sequence, fails to appreciate fully the poetry's formal properties and so the poetry requires a close reading. Formalism is applied to study the poem and the study stresses the analysis of the work as a self-sufficient verbal entity, constituted by internal relations and independent of reference either to the state of mind of Soyinka or the actualities of the `external' world. The approach highlights in a fresh manner the elements which the earlier criticism the poetry stresses to reveal Soyinka's mythologization of death and preoccupation with ritual forms in ""Procession"". The study reveals that Soyinka is not just preoccupied with political imprisonment and judicial death but mythologizes the experience and treats rites de passage.

I use data from an audience survey in two art museums in Flanders (Belgium) (n = 1448) and analyse aesthetic dispositions towards visual arts and towards music. Applying Relational Class Analysis, I find different dispositional configurations. These configurations are characterised by oppositions between aesthetic principles that do not coincide with the oppositions between aesthetic principles in the cultural field. Moreover, these configurations suggest that dispositions vary to the extent that they are transposable across aesthetic domains. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, Adam manages proximity through two distinct chronotopes, or arrangements of time and space, an OCD chronotope and a bird's eye chronotope.

"English","Public museums; Deaccessioning; Visitor attitudes; Structural equation models; Italy; Socio-demographic determinants","CULTURE","Deaccessioning is a largely controversial practice involving the sale or disposal of objects from a museum's collection. Although it has received increasing attention in the past few decades as a solution to museums' financial concerns, its implications on museum management have rarely been researched in academia. Previous research suggests that visitors' responses may vary depending on factors like the proposed use of income generated by deaccessioning operations and the public's perception of the museum collection as a public good. We examine the validity of these claims by collecting visitors' responses from two Italian sites of art-historical interest and analyse visitors' attitude to deaccessioning in Italian public museums in general. We hypothesise that the public cultural identity of the collection and the purpose of the income generated by deaccessioning strongly affect visitors' attitudes toward this practice. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we estimate several important determinants of visitors' responses. We also show that attitudes toward deaccessioning do not influence respondents' decision to visit a museum. Implications for museum governance and for the literature on deaccessioning in cultural economics are discussed.",96,"WOS:000411301200004",3

This article aims to examine the above-mentioned novels in terms of posthumanism, focusing on one of the well-known theorists of this field, Francis Fukuyama, who in Our Posthuman Future treats posthumanism as a threat to humanistic values. Fukuyama warns against a posthuman future in which technology will give us the capacity to modify the essence of human nature gradually, over time. The focus of this article will be on ""Factor X"", a concept introduced by Fukuyama, and the ways in which the characters of the novels possess it, or come into its possession. The ways in which Fukuyama's pathways to a posthuman world are realised in the dystopian worlds that Huxley and lshiguro create, are also discussed.",15,"WOS:000405334200002",3

In this paper, I start from an example based on the relative ineffability of kinaesthetic representations, i.e. representations involving bodily posture and movement, and then generalise the discussion by looking at the reasons why - even when there are no limits on either the richness of available contexts or the ways in which contextual material could be used to enrich linguistically encoded meanings - perceptual/phenomenal representations test our expressive capacities to the limit. Some recent work on linguistics suggests that the ineffability problem arises mainly with words whose linguistic meanings are tightly associated with perception. Arguing that a much wider variety of linguistic expressions can evoke phenomenal states - including proper names, whose main function is referential - I will try to show that the challenges phenomenal experience poses for our communicative abilities reach well beyond the limited range of those expressions tightly associated with emotion and perception.",47,"WOS:000399451200003",3

My aim is to show through a close reading of one hip-hop song from Kenya how hip-hop creates a reality within its own semiotic space. To this end, I focus on how the urban African space is developed textually through different elements such as the rapper's persona, language, and topoi within the text. By looking at how the artiste uses recurring leitmotifs, figures, and hip-hop discursive strategies, I show how the narrative of the city within the text is not simply a reflection of a context but rather an artistic construct.",29,"WOS:000399174100009",3

Undertaking case studies of the autobiographically informed magical realist novel Going After Cacciato and the short-story collection The Things They Carried, a text that suggestively functions as both fiction and autobiography, this article attends to the paradoxes of fantasy-filled life writing', revealing a convergence between magical realism and testimony when it comes to the representation of trauma.",34,"WOS:000404903300006",3
"English","transmedia; adaptation; television; justified",,"Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens appears in a body of work penned by Elmore Leonard and a FX television series developed and produced by Graham Yost forming the Raylan Givens franchise. Despite the character's cross-platform presence, the storytelling strategies implemented by Leonard and Yost ultimately do not represent an example of transmedia storytelling. Yet, Justified's storytelling approach challenges normative understandings of the boundaries between transmedia storytelling and transmedia adaptation. Whereas transmedia storytelling and adaptation are typically conceptualized as fixed binaries, the interplay between Leonard's Raylan Givens' fiction and the FX television series illustrates a more fluid model. The strategies of narrative extension and narrative transposition utilized by Leonard and Yost resulted in the matrix of texts featuring Raylan Givens oscillating back and forth across the dividing line separating adaptation and transmedia storytelling. In this way, Justified's storytelling approach highlights the ways in which the boundary nothing between transmedia storytelling and adaptation is porous. Moreover, as Justified's position as a privileged adaptation increased over the course of the first season, the canonical status of a key event in the short story upon which the series is based also shifted. While Justified ultimately adapted the narrative universe of Leonard's Raylan Givens fiction throughout the television series' first three seasons, Leonard's Raylan reversed this adaptational directionality by adhering to the storyline depicted in the series. Hence, Raylan occupies a dual position as both a source text and an adaptation in a way that illustrates how the ascendancy of an adapted text can shift the adaptational directionality within a franchise, thereby becoming the dominant version of a narrative universe.",38,"WOS:000397958600001",3

"English","cosmopolitanism; nationalism; French Enlightenment; early German Romanticism; modern literary theory",,"Despite habitual assumptions, cosmopolitanism is a deeply divided phenomenon, carried either by the dominant or dominated agencies. If it is launched by the first carrier group, it is self-asserting and self-expanding, if by the second, it is other-related and interlocking, i.e. looking for allies in order to strengthen its carriers' aspirations. In political terms, the first kind of cosmopolitanism is usually interpreted as colonial or hegemonic, the second as postcolonial or liberating. In psychoanalytical terms, the theorists speak of an ""appropriative"" identification of the other as the self's object vs. ""non-appropriative"" identification with the other as the self's model. The other figures either as an object for the self's assertion or as an invitation to the self's exemption from his or her given identity. Because one kind of the self's relationship to the other disconcerts the other as its uncanny shadow, cosmopolitanism is doomed to a persistent transfiguration. The paper presents three historically successive cases in point.

Parodic play in this novel highlights how the apparently monstrous patriarch and the daily perversions of traditional marriage and household ideals represent the only security for both relatively advantaged and disadvantaged women in twenty-first-century Nigeria. I embed my literary analysis of the novel within a survey of history and religion to show how monogamy confirmed the moral superiority of the colonial and Christian missionary projects and justified their social interventions. To contextualise this study of the novel, I also use socio-anthropological literature that connects the global forces promoting romantic love as the sole foundation of monogamous marriage with, ironically, the global flows that create the punitive economic and social conditions to which plural marriage is an entirely rational response shaped by local cultural contexts.",28,"WOS:000393150300003",3

Salisbury, later Harare, is likened to an undefeatable seductress who traps and ruins men by introducing them to her twin pleasures of cheap beer and fast women. Thus, on the surface, the city appears to be responsible for social corruption and moral decay. A close reading of the imagery in both novels, however, reveals that both authors refrain from regurgitating the programmatic and rather simplistic ""old society versus modern lifestyle"" trope that has permeated the discourse of urbanization in Shona literature.

"English","Korean shamanism; Manshin; intermediality; remediation; fantastic; materialist historiography; profanation","MEDIA","Despite the recent increased interest in Korean shamanism in Korean film studies, most relevant publications have tended to confine their discussions only to the question of the legitimacy of Korean films' representations of Korean shamanism. In doing so, existing Korean film scholarship has not yet substantially explored equally important questions such as: What different aesthetic techniques have the Korean films about shamanism employed to represent and/or express the subjective and objective experiences of Korean shamanic rituals? What are the socio-cultural and political implications of these cinematic engagements with Korean shamanism? The need for a closer look at these issues has become more obvious as new, more experimental Korean films and other forms of media dealing with shamanism have appeared during the past decade. Park Chan-kyong's experimental documentary Manshin: Ten Thousand Spirits (2013) is especially notable in this regard since it employs digitally-enabled intermedial techniques. This paper explores the ways in which Manshin's use of these techniques is able to express the cultural otherness of Korean shamanism. I will argue that this film's hypermediated use of several intermedial techniques enables it to express the fantastic quality of trance-like shamanic experiences, rewrite the biography of shaman Kim Keum-hwa and the history of Korean shamanism in the form of materialist historiography, and profane shamanic practices against the recent tendency to spectacularize them. In this regard, Manshin can be seen to significantly contribute to a reimagining of the postcolonial nation of Korea as one that is irreducibly heterogeneous and open to new socio-cultural possibilities.",30,"WOS:000417475000006",3

"English","Digital literature; Authoring tool; Imaginary; Globalization",,"Digital writing necessarily requires tools, software or technology. With its constant development, the technology must be ""intuitive"" and easy to use, with no need for a manual. This intuitive use of the software authoring tool as a kind of universal language places it squarely in the globalization process. A question then arises: while allowing some degree of fair competition, does globalization not also entail a uniform way of producing, doing or thinking? Since the tools used by many digital authors were first developed for commercial purposes, we can ask whether this fact affects their imaginary when they write. Keeping in mind the globalized environment, I will illustrate the closed relationship in which the tools themselves make certain proposals and then anticipate certain specific practices, i.e., how globalization can structure the discourse and influence how authors think about creating their works. There is a globalized imaginary in which communications technology is becoming increasingly interconnected, and in which our imagination inevitably becomes globalized, reflecting beliefs and economic/socio-cultural structures that challenge national boundaries and shift the balance of power. Lev Manovich talks about ""cultural software"" (2010), while Edgar Morin recognizes the existence of a global civilization that includes standard shared values.

"English",,,"Drama and theatre, which are distinctive forms of art, stand among those concepts which are often used interchangeably regardless of their uniqueness. In order to contextualize and reassess this relationship between drama and theatre, Hans-Thies Lehmann, a German scholar and theoretician, has provided a useful formulation in his ground-breaking study Postdramatic Theatre. He claims that theatre has been subordinated by drama particularly in western cultures until the 1960s. This has naturally resulted in a domineering position of the dramatic text and the playwright in the final production. Lehmann argues that since the 1960s western theatre has demonstrated an interest in creating theatrical productions which display an equal treatment of the playtext, playwright, director, performers, costumes, decor, etc. in order to subvert the rooted hierarchal order. In his book, he does not neglect to mention that British ""in-yer-face"" dramatists are also among those who have influenced the emergence of German-based productions with their shock tactics to capture the audience. In such productions, the events happening on the stage make the audience feel as if they are attacked. The British playwright, Mark Raven hill, is one of such in-yer-face dramatists.

I claim that authorial concerns, instead of manifesting themselves in imposing intrusions, may take the form of agential indecision, reflecting the ultimate imbalance between lived experience and its artistic framing. As a narrative emblem of this relativist stance toward knowledge and authority, I deal with focalizers who assume authorial postures in their present-tense internal discourse and by doing so juxtapose existentialist immediacy of experience with artistic maneuvering. The ultimate locus for authorial ethos without authoritativeness is found in the gnomic statement that is framed by free indirect discourse and ambivalent pronominal reference. My main test case is Michael Cunningham's novel By Nightfall (2010), but I also discuss its intertextual networking with Madame Bovary, Death in Venice, and Disgrace. In its keen attention to gnomic statements, Cohn's canonical analysis of Death in Venice serves as a methodological inspiration. I suggest that By Nightfall offers an unconventional reading of Mann's novella by drawing an analogy between the protagonists of these two novels: the self-deprecation and aesthetic perfectionism of Cunningham's protagonist preoccupies the very narrative discourse that nevertheless refers to him in the third-person, suggesting that also Aschenbach may have more narrative control over his downfall than Cohn is ready to allow him.

In doing so, I show how recent interdisciplinary discussions of sound and auditory perception might be utilized to open up new ways of reading canonical modernist texts. Conversely, I mobilize Kafka's text in order to complicate existing accounts of acoustical modernity, which tend to prioritize scientific and technical accounts over the literary and, in the process, modes of objective observation and technological disembodiment over those of embodied listening. If existing scholarship on ""Der Bau"" has tended to focus on psychological issues such as madness and paranoia, I read the work as a meditation on the corporeality of listening and its potentially destabilizing implications for subjectivity and perceptual experience. The protagonist's reckoning with acoustical embodiment, I argue, is both facilitated and obstructed by a diverse combination of visual and acoustic self-observations, displaced corporeality, and narrative self-reflexivity, all of which converge around the appearance of a mysterious figure and suspected threat from without, an unverifiable intruder, heard but never seen, believed to lurk within the protagonist's underground home.",76,"WOS:000406532500005",3

While migration literature describes the station as a place of belonging, other contemporary representations of Termini depict it as a non-place, revealing the fear of a globalised world.

"English","intermediality; narrative music; narrative pictures; narratology; prototype semantics","NARRATIVITY","Drawing on research by, among others, Monika Fludernik, Marie-Laure Ryan, and previous publications by the author, the present article outlines the foundations of a transmedial narratology that draws on intermediality theory, frame theory, and prototype semantics. These foundations permit the simultaneous conceptualization of narrative as a semiotic macro-mode and as a cognitive frame which enables recipients to classify given artifacts (texts, performances, etc.) as more or less narrative in accordance with the extent to which ""narremes"" as features of prototypical narratives can be recognized. This approach is illustrated with examples taken from three media: literary fiction, the visual arts, and instrumental music. The comparison of the different narrative potentials of these media leads to some general reflections on both the recipient's and the artifact's share in narrativization (the artifact and the medium it belongs to can be strongly narrative, more or less narrativity-inducing, or non-narrative), moreover on constitutive elements of a media-conscious narratology, and a typology of medial realization of narrativity based on transmission modes.

While his protagonists' longing for the past seem to hold the promise of creating continuity between traditions, their attitude in fact amounts only to coveting the past as an object-a desire to possess the past and to become its master through putting it outside of time and reason, thereby creating a beautiful shelter from the tensions of modernization.",21,"WOS:000419063500007",3

By orchestrating a series of imagined encounters between Chinese nationals and Chinese living overseas, Li's fiction challenges ethnocentric conceptions of identity and signals the inadequacy of any understanding of risk that is not culturally, historically and geographically situated. Li's narratives indicate the ways in which new conceptions of risk, influenced by but not identical to the uncertain dynamics of the 'risk society', are developing in post-Mao China. Whereas the 'risk society' is the result of scepticism towards modernity, contemporary Chinese culture is broadly optimistic regarding progress and industrialisation. Li's work is unique insofar as it signals the ways in which conceptions of risk from the West are subtly interacting with and altering conceptions of fragility and uncertainty in China and in turn sheds light on the constructed nature of 'risk' under globalisation.",25,"WOS:000396780800006",3

Textual history has impeded their categorical recognition: in 1924, when Desire under the Elms was first published and performed, 39 percent of O'Neill's oeuvre (seventeen of forty-four plays), but just 19 percent of his staged work (five of twenty-six plays) and 16 percent of his published work (four of twenty-five), was comic or metacomic.

This article investigates the community that these publications established, and thepurpose of their community-making. The avant-gardist communities reflect the heterogeneous character of the Jewish community by questioning the principles of identity and sameness as their foundation. Arguably, the impulse to modernise the Jewish community led to a double de-territorialisation: German-Jewish artists involved in the avant-garde were revisionists within Jewry and yet too Jewish' for the mainstream population.

As a result, English grammar went through several attempts to codify and prescribe rules for correct usage, so that the number of these works increased rapidly from the 1760s onwards and reached a notable peak in the 1790s. In order to find a place in an increasingly saturated marketplace, authors, editors and publishers variously resorted to selling strategies that included, for instance, adding value to the English grammar by incorporating rich prefatory or post-main-text matter.

Barnes' Fuentes para el estudio de la paidologia (1917), Paidologia (1918, 1924, 1932), El desenvolvimiento del nino (1928, 1933) and related works bring together empirical and experimental cognitive work as well as biological, vitalist and holistic conceptions of the child.

This article examines how changing paradigms in European science and philosophy marked Barnes' intellectual production. Specifically, it considers the rise of holistic thought such as Gestalt theory as set out by Kurt Koffka (1926), popularized by Ortega y Gasset, and discussed by primary school teachers such as Rafael Verdier, Teodoro Causi, Juan Jaen and Jose Peinado.

"English",,,"During the long eighteenth century, metaphors and analogies associated with clockwork mechanisms were frequently used to critique the perceived constraints of Augustan prosody. Despite this, a new generation of theorists, who rejected established prosodic conventions and proposed less restrictive metrical practices, frequently deployed references to pendulums positively when emphasizing the advantages of greater prosodic flexibility. Consequently, the image of a swinging bob became a deeply conflicted one in discussions of versification during this period. Accruing diametrically opposed associations, the analogy could denote oppressive regularity but also liberating variety. Drawing extensively on existing studies of prosodic theory and practice, this article explores these puzzling tendencies, arguing that pendulums were able to serve these antithetical rhetorical purposes because they were allied to organic as well as mechanical phenomena. Therefore they could function in an intermediary capacity, synchronizing the isochronicities of literature with those of the natural world. This development sheds a revealing light on how changing perceptions of the relationship between mechanism and organicism came to characterize the different theories of prosody that emerged as the long eighteenth century advanced.",105,"WOS:000411226000006",3

This article contends that the short stories in Lawrence Hoba's collection The Trek and Other Stories epitomises this strand of narrative aesthetic in their critical engagement with the state's narrative of land. It explores the short stories' treatment of the land question, particularly their depiction of the ironic ambivalence of black beneficiaries of the government's land resettlement programme.

Its long absence from the public domain renders it permanently anachronistic, since it was was never able to address directly its early twentieth century context. This paper considers how Maurice, in lamenting the oppression of homosexual men, offers a trenchant criticism of aspects of the social fabric' itself, including contemporary constructions of masculinity. Alan Hollinghurst's The Swimming-Pool Library, published in 1988, is imbued with Forsterian echoes. Unlike Maurice, it was able to engage more openly with its social and political context; unlike the repressed Maurice Hall, its protagonist, Will Beckwith, enjoys what seems to be a sexually liberated lifestyle. However, Hollinghurst's social criticism is if anything more stringent than Forster's, for he shows that, despite the apparent sexual freedom enjoyed by gay men, there has been very little progress where the inclusion of these men in the social fabric' is concerned. This makes his novel darker and bleaker than Forster's.

Among the innovations they contribute are new forms of monsters, diverging from earlier Gothic or mythological traditions, which spring, in part, from a strand of post-Darwinian thought that understood any bodily shape to be possible in adaptation to environmental conditions. This paper explores three stories which, by staging human encounters with animal monsters of radical unknown shapes, suggest new ways in which humans and animals might relate to each other: William Hope Hodgson's The Boats of the 'Glen Carrig' (1908), Arthur Conan Doyle's 'The Horror of the Heights' (1913) and Will A. Page' 'The Air Serpent' (1911). The encounter between characters and monsters is at root a colonial encounter between humans and the natural world, and often a violent one. By presenting weird animals as monstrous, the stories engage a number of anxieties associated with human-animal kinship and evolutionary superiority. By presenting monsters as strange Others but also as fellow creatures fit for their environments, however, these tales reach towards understanding animals as subjects in their own right with a claim to existing in their own spaces, destabilising the anthropocentric assumptions with which the human characters approach their adventures.",58,"WOS:000410830500003",3

Through this patterning, Spenser suggests that his courtship does not merely evoke but necessitates metamorphosis, in both the beloved who represents Elizabeth Boyle, his intended, and the lover who represents himself. As the title of his sequence indicates, Spenser connects transformation of the lady, whom he identifies at first as a donna angelica, with the mythology and mythography of Cupid. Inseparable from his doing so-and of greater subtlety-is his portraying her in association with the mythology as well as mythography of Venus. He likewise links the transformation required of his persona with the figure of Cupid; nonetheless, with greater subtlety he associates his persona with the figure and lore of Ulysses. Impelling their mutually interactive transformations, Spenser intimates, is an experience of love where eros and agape meet in eventual and unstable harmony as caritas.

Yet they were also often preoccupied with how difficult many readers found it to even understand him. This essay examines statements of both kinds from the early and mid-century, to argue that in the 1750s, distinctively, commentators concluded both that Shakespeare was 'modern'-in the sense that he wrote in an everyday idiom, unbound by classical conventions-and that he was 'ancient', in the sense that Elizabethan culture and its language itself had become historically alien and obscure. Comparing representations of Shakespeare by Samuel Richardson, Samuel Johnson, Edward Young, Charlotte Lennox, David Hume, and other writers of the 1750s, with their forebears in the earlier parts of the century, this essay makes the case for the originality of this position, and considers the implications of the paradoxical fact that Shakespeare seemed to become 'ancient' and 'modern' simultaneously at this time.",50,"WOS:000411084300009",3

The chaos that narrative repetition creates stunts the development of identity, in both senses of the word.

Ros was not accepted on its own terms high-status critics appropriated ros through a process of ""categorical divestment."" Through explicit and implicit comparisons, ros was recast as a serious wine and stripped of its feminine, low-status associations.

Both humorous and sad, it has been categorised as literary fiction, detective fiction and a psychological thriller, and is thus a ""hybrid"" genre novel that is difficult to categorise neatly. The novel's chief protagonist and narrator is Maud, who has dementia. As a narrator Maud is extremely unreliable and often forgets facts and events even as they are unfolding around her. Maud's memories, however, have a much higher degree of specificity than her present day narratives: they are richer, more detailed, and therefore much more reliable, than the narrative of her current life. Consequently, the novel is characterised by a stylistic contrast between the vague and the specific, the remembered and the forgotten. In order to investigate this contrast, this paper argues that a stylistic account of Cognitive Grammar can shed further light on how Maud's cognitive habits are represented in the novel, and are represented in the novel, and how these in turn impact upon text-world representation. The analysis draws upon Cognitive Grammar's construal processes, in particular, to explore the fictive illustration of mind style - and of memory - in this literary context.

Using in-depth interviews conducted in North-Western Europe with young business professionals, discourses around cultural taste are explored with a focus on music and the visual arts. Earlier research ascribes a rather conservative highbrow taste to economic elites, while recent studies have indicated the benefits of omnivorousness for business professionals. The cultural consumption practices of young business professionals are discussed in relation to their social networks (social capital) and career advancement. The interviews reveal that within their discourse on taste, relevant boundaries are often based on morals rather than aesthetics. While they demonstrate openness towards many forms of cultural participation, highbrow discourse appears rather irrelevant. Cultural consumption plays a modest role in the lives of the interviewees, who consider sociability and work ethic more relevant when engaging in social and professional relations. Apart from increasing our understanding of the relevance of music and the arts among young business professionals, this study highlights the need to re-connect discussions on social and cultural capital.

This essay contributes an understanding of this issue by exploring the temporalities of ethical regard and disregard for trees in the context of urban timescapes. The exploration of ethical urban temporalities is organized around three digital artistic interventions focused on Paris (One Heart One Tree), New York City (PopUP Forest), and London (Trees on Sidewalks). These interventions are examined as ecocritical case studies, which aim to confront and subsequently rearticulate human-tree relations, using the city as a material and symbolic site to facilitate ecological awareness and disruption.

The use of digital media in each case is discussed with respect to how the interventions differentially make urban ecological temporalities (in)visible.

"English",,,"Especially before the eighteenth century, many European writers regarded not apes but elephants as the most humanlike animals because of their high intelligence, even rationality. The largely forgotten rational elephant can help us read early modern anthropocentrism against itself and distinguish early modernity from modernity in ways that historicize and denaturalize these periods' different speciesisms. Giovanni Battista Gelli's La Circe (1549), for instance, produces a philosophy of human exceptionalism by suppressing the elephant's natural history whether propagandistically or ironically. Subsequent texts by writers from Montaigne, in the sixteenth century, to Pope, Buffon, and Pennant, in the eighteenth, demonstrate that the rational elephant threatens human exceptionalism even after Descartes's seventeenth-century and Linnaeus's eighteenth-century interventions. Though speciesist itself, the rational elephant reveals a bygone paradigm more capable than the modern one of acknowledging rationality across bodily differences. It also provides a historically grounded vantage point from which the primacy of the primates can be overthrown.",61,"WOS:000419083500005",3

It was truly a battle over the central question of what modernism ought to be: in Pound's estimation, a small and hierarchized sliver of literary elite vying for central control over literary production and its audience or, in Lowell's project, a collective approach to literature in which authors work collaboratively to generate widespread popularity for modernist poetry.",45,"WOS:000416779700002",3

Sarcasm is possibly the worst form of comedy or humor, being biting, angry, and reflecting a sense of desperation. While previous scholarship has extensively worked on irony, satire, and parody, the existence of sarcasm at that early time also deserves to be taken into account, since it often appears to undermine harshly the idyllic impressions of courtly life and threatens to destroy the last shreds of social harmony and to remove any hope for the reconstruction of a happier form of cohabitation and collaboration.",48,"WOS:000403574900006",3

The 1922 declaration of Egyptian independence and 1923 opening of King Tutankhamun's tomb not only coincide historically with the 1922-1923 upwelling of modernist literature, they also make the politics of decolonization central to modernism's narratives of national identity and modernity itself. Viewing this period through the lens of H. D.'s ""Secret Name: Excavator's Egypt (circa 1925 A. D.)""

Offsetting the absence of contemporary Egyptian politicians in these literary texts, representations of a resistant Egyptian landscape, language, culture, and art reveal the fundamental challenge Egypt's decolonization posed to American and British identity.

This representation is a form of epistemological romance, interlacing past and present in the attempt to reclaim these traces as living history rather than as markers of pastness. As in the 1930s itself, imaginative retreat is exploded by the return of First World War to the public memory: in The Nine Tailors, this occurs in the form of a corpse metonymically loaded with wartime significance.

The art of dying well traditionally demanded the exclusion of fear and doubt, requiring that the dying individual face mortality placidly, obediently, even joyfully, in order to ensure salvation. I argue that the Devotions challenges the efficacy of the ars as a model for achieving spiritual health on the deathbed, showing how its elisions of the particularities of suffering cannot universally serve the sick and dying. Instead, Donne presents an alternative, which, like his early Holy Sonnets, incorporates the experience of fear, impatience, and doubt into the aims of the text and suggests that the end of life cannot, and perhaps should not, be approached as calmly as the ""ideal"" model demands.",71,"WOS:000398883100005",3

My analysis of Nunez y Topete's works extends scholarship on the cursi in the Spanish fin-de-siecle context, which has concentrated almost exclusively on male writers. The cursi was also imbricated in contemporary debates around what constituted sham and genuine culture, the retrograde and modern, and ultimately, foreign imitation and Spanish realist original.

Like much of Palacio Valdes's output, Sinfonia pastoral has been more popular with readers than with scholars, partly because of its sentimentality, but mainly because of its belatedness. Starting from Edward Said's reflections on ""late style,"" this essay distinguishes between two varieties of untimeliness: by anticipation and by reversion. Untimely by reversion, Sinfonia pastoral looks back to Palacio Valdes's beginnings as a novelist and, concretely, to his second novel, El idilio de un enfermo (1884), which the later novel revises. The wager of the untimely work is that its time will come. For works untimely by anticipation, this day arrives by definition. Written ahead of their time, sooner or later the future catches up to them. But the untimely works by reversion face a less certain fate.

"English","Erich Auerbach; late reading; philology; comparative literature; world literature",,"Focusing in particular on Erich Auerbach's seminal essay 'Philology of World Literature' (1952), this essay proposes to re-examine the conceptualization of comparative literature in the post-WWII period not only from the perspective of its philological, but also from that of its historical self-understanding. Its principal concern will be to consider what it means to view this comparative philology as historical, which is to say in the context of how it emerges from the particular 'historical perspectivism' of the immediate post-war period. The category that best characterizes this philology, it will be argued, is that of late reading, a term that the essay coins as the hermeneutic counterpart to the artistic concept of late style. Characterized by its consciousness of coming at the end of the tradition of European high culture, late reading - at least in Auerbach's understanding of it - makes its very lateness a constituent element of its hermeneutics. Out of this sense of lateness emerges, the essay will argue, a view of comparative literature as defined by its distance from the normative maturity of classical European culture - by what one might term, in Frank Kermode's phrase, its 'sense of an ending'. Auerbach's conception of world philology does not ignore the increasing obsolescence of the Eurocentric perspective, but rather makes this obsolescence the basis of its synoptic purview. As such, it continues to offer a model for how comparative literature may engage with the legacy of high European culture whilst acknowledging the limitations of its perspective.",43,"WOS:000401349500006",3

"English","Work-Study Scheme; Chinese intellectuals; May Fourth Movement; Franco-Chinese relations",,"Following World War I, and what many perceived as China's unfair treatment in the Treaty of Versailles, numerous Chinese intellectuals joined the influential May Fourth Movement (1919-1932) to protest social and cultural conditions in their country, and promoted study abroad in France through the Work-Study Scheme (or Diligent Work-Frugal Study movement) as a means to acquire technical skills like engineering while learning to strengthen China politically. Through participation therein, they began to view revolutionary France as a wellspring for inspiring political reform within Republican China (1912-1949). Sheng Cheng (1899-1996) was one such patriotic student who called for revolutionary change in his society, and in his writings connected China's contemporary political struggles with France's own revolutionary past. A nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) supporter traveling to France for this initiative, Sheng joined the Societe Franco-Chinoise d'Education, and staying there for ten years wrote and lectured as a public intellectual.The article examines Sheng's writing of personal history to engage in political activism, and in particular, his key work, the allegorical Ma Mere, in the wider context of the interwar period Franco-Chinese relations and the heritage of the French Revolution.",13,"WOS:000401438200006",3
"English","Hospitality; fundamentalism; violence; autoimmunity; terror",,"For a novel consistently teetering on the brink of violence, Mohsin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist begins in a surprisingly benign manner but ultimately offers a sustained interrogation of the possibilities and limits of hospitality in a time of terror. The novel is permeated by references to familiar forms of hospitality and their ultimate failure, yet this article focuses more specifically on the troubling implications The Reluctant Fundamentalist has for a philosophy of hospitality; that is, what appears as a failure of hospitalitythe inevitable violence of the novel's conclusionis actually a provocative and sustained engagement with hospitality in its most pure and terrifying form. Using the figures offered to us by Immanuel Kant and Jacques Derrida, I argue that the novel theorizes a hospitality given even and especially when the face of the other is the irreducible face of death. It exemplifies what Gideon Baker conceptualizes as cosmopolitanism as hospitalityan ethics that opens to difference as Other whatever that other may bring in his infinitely unknowable state. Ultimately, The Reluctant Fundamentalist suggests that if absolute hospitality is an openness to whoever or whatever arrives, then included in that is a hospitality even to the one who comes to kill.",28,"WOS:000400008800003",3
"English","Korol Lir; Kozintsev; King Lear; Dover cliff; space; the crowd","'KING-LEAR'","For a whole host of critics, the 1970 Russian film version of King Lear (Korol Lir) directed by Grigori Kozintsev represents the pinnacle of Shakespeare on film. Yet the film infamously cuts perhaps the most famous scene of the play-the scene at Dover cliff, in which Edgar leads the blinded Gloucester to an imaginary precipice and improvises a sublime poetic portrait of everyday plebeian life, before stepping aside to watch Gloucester take an undignified pratfall onto the flat stage. This absence has been taken by some critics to be paradigmatic of the inability of conventional film to recreate the fluidity of early-modern stage space. Yet critics have been too ready to suppose that the absence of the Dover cliff scene from Korol Lir is testament to the limits of film and not to its opportunities. Drawing on the diary that Kozintsev kept while filming Korol Lir-published under the title King Lear: The Space of Tragedy-and the work of Siegfried Kracauer, I contend that the Dover cliff scene is absent from Korol Lir, not simply because it is 'unfilmable', but because it is redundant: Kozintsev can use the photo-realist space of film to actualize the vision of everyday life forged by Edgar in any frame he wishes. In his bid to capture a wider social reality than is possible on stage, I contend that Kozintsev makes particular use of crowd scenes, from the opening moments of the film all the way to its bloody denouement.",33,"WOS:000407110700005",3
"English",,,"For Aldous Huxley, the two most distressing things about people unlike himself are their ignorance and their birthrates, both of which are threatening the intellectualism that Huxley most admires. Huxley's own definition of Englishness is tied to intellectual and racial snobbery; people of his own race, status, and level of intelligence count as ""English,"" and he believes they are rapidly being overwhelmed by people of inferior quality from Asia, the Americas and the former colonies. Huxley's dystopian novel Ape and Essence (1948) ostensibly satirizes runaway technology, religious fanaticism, and government control, but the nostalgic ideal of white English superiority is also very much evident. The novel focuses on Huxley's prediction of horrible consequences when an ascendant lower class gains control. Ape and Essence portrays a society that has lost that which Huxley believes the intellectual elite protects culture, tradition, and intelligence and he does not allow the idea that the masses have the ability to do anything but destroy and pervert. Nearly all of this predicted destruction is caused by simple overpopulation, at least in Huxley's view, and he fears that the culture wars are being won by the masses simply because they are massive.",18,"WOS:000401295900002",3
"English","Walter Scott; sovereignty; nationhood; home; monarchy; political conservatism",,"For all their differences, Scott's The Fortunes of Nigel and The Heart of Mid-Lothian have distinct similarities. Each has a morally upright protagonist and is set some years after a Scottish-English union has been effected. More important is that each depicts a journey from Scotland to England in search of justice at the monarch's hand and, inseparably from that, the establishing of a secure domestic space - the creation of a home - that emblematises the concept of successfully co-existent English and Scottish cultural identities. Both novels are thus specifically concerned with the achievement of justice in Scotland by the then-British monarch located in England. The Fortunes of Nigel, set in the reign of James I, considers the factors - personal, political, theological and social - arguably contributing to the overthrow of Charles I's sovereignty and the establishment of the Interregnum. The Heart of Mid-Lothian considers questions of rebellion and societal injustice within the framework of the Hanoverian dynastic rule over Britain, after the English Revolution and the Glorious Revolution. In that context of political upheaval, what is of particular interest is therefore the exploration of what could be called the continuum between home and nation in the two novels: the experiences of an insecure domestic space and of an unstable national identity by members of two different social classes, in two different historical periods, under two different yet sequent monarchies.",24,"WOS:000410647000003",3
"English","Performance; politics of practice; personality; intellectual history",,"For British historian Raphael Samuel, history and politics were inextricable. Best known as the founder of the history workshop movement, the controversial historian took his stance on the democratisation of history-making, becoming an outspoken advocate for public history. Despite making a significant contribution to contemporary historiography, he remains a neglected, even disparaged, figure. This paper contends that the most significant aspect of Samuel's historical work was not one or other theory of history or argument about the past but his entire way of being an historian. Samuel embodied as much as expressed his ideas, consciously using his personality as a powerful political tool. It is further argued that conventional approaches to intellectual history, focusing on textual outputs, do not fully recognise the significance of performative modes of thinking. Theoretical approaches to performance as identity offer important insight here but can be too schematic in their view of applied and enacted thought. A biographical approach, by contrast, provides the intimate perspective necessary to fully appreciate the fluidity and complexity of such a personality.The paper first situates Samuel in the context of his earlier life, focusing on how and why he created such a public persona and how he adapted it in response to changing circumstances. It then considers the implications and effectiveness of this persona by assessing how it was perceived and narrated by others, acknowledging, in the process, why different groups engaged with and interpreted it differently.",60,"WOS:000392419900003",3
"English",,,"For many critics, Charlotte Dacre is an essentially conservative author, whose female villains ventriloquize and thereby discredit early feminist thought. This essay disputes such readings by exploring her under-acknowledged criticisms of patriarchy. Dacre's male characters are self-important narcissists, who disdain female education for the agency it gives women. If a woman is well-educated, she is less likely to submit, less likely to serve as an extension of her husband's will alone. Patriarchy also encourages women to turn on one another, Dacre argues; her female villains uniformly value advancement among men over sisterhood, and they willingly destroy other women to attain their own ends. Dacre thus takes a pessimistic approach to women's options at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Her female characters do not enjoy happy endings, regardless of marital status, level of education, or morality, because patriarchal systems are designed to crush women no matter how they behave. Far from mocking early feminism, then, Dacre criticizes it for being insufficiently radical in addressing problems with male behaviour.",0,"WOS:000419444400004",3

Work in animal studies and performance theory overlooks this phenomenon when it laments theater's unbroken history of animal exclusion a notion of exclusion that quadruped dramas actually helped propagate and reinforce. The animal melodramas produced through the Victorian era featured animal characters whose appeal depended on the perceived otherness of animal actors, especially the knowledge that animals did not so much act in the drama as perform set responses to subtle, real-world cues from their trainers. Playwrights used animals' imperfect integration in the dramatic illusion to inject an uncanny sense of reality into their melodramatic plots. Their experiments with estrangement admit the difficulties of animal performance by explicitly staging animal otherness but only as a spur to deepen human engagement with the more-than-human world.",51,"WOS:000411419600003",3

This essay examines the reasons behind Heaney's increasing immersion in Greek literature from the mid-1980s onwards. It examines how the political and ethical issues Sophocles addresses in Philoctetes drew him to the play, and identifies the contexts - international and local - which shaped The Cure at Troy's composition and reception. Unlike many previous discussions which dwell primarily on material Heaney added to the original, this essay offers a meticulous analysis of the entire Cure. It evaluates the quality of its poetry and its relationship to Heaney's lyric work up to 1990 and after. A recurring focus of interest are those moments and extended passages where Heaney takes greatest pains to make the source text his own, to settle in and colonize' it. In demonstrating where, when and why divergences occur, his version is repeatedly compared and contrasted with those of four other eminent translators. What emerges from this is how fully he sought to re-imagine the characters and recast the Chorus, ensuring the audience's empathy for and engagement with these flawed specimens of humanity.",22,"WOS:000401448100011",3

Addressing a readership that spans countries and continents, this kind of writing functions as a viable tributary to world literature. On the other hand, a new boom of Indian mass fiction in English has emerged that, while targeting a strictly domestic audience, is always already implicated in the dynamics of world literature as well, albeit in a very different way: As they deploy, appropriate and adopt a wide range of globally available templates of popular genres, these texts have globality inscribed into their very textures even if they do not circulate internationally.",61,"WOS:000398110400008",3

This reflected the worldwide iconisation of Mandela as a popular cultural and political symbol for human rights, political messiah-hood, sainthood, dignity, peace and forgiveness. Noting that in his lifetime, even, Mandela attempted to deflect and qualify this iconisation, we present critical views of what we call ""Mandelaism"" to describe the cultural practices and sign systems that surround and mythologise Mandela. Mandelaism is intermeshed with, feeds into and draws on patriotic sentiments, often invoking notions of magical powers to reconcile racial divisions, to right wrongs of the past and to nation-build. Mandelaism, we notice, is sometimes hijacked by self-serving machinations. Located in the context of the news-event that was Mandela's death and funeral, this aims to recognize self-serving corporate communications which invoke or play on Mandelaism. We do this with reference to selected corporate advertisements that were published in selected national English-language newspapers in the two weeks following his death.

As well as identifying a key source for the Palladis in Jean Dadre's Loci communes similium et dissimilium (1577), my argument draws on the annotations in a number of newly-uncovered books from Meres's library, and on the epitaph that he wrote for his wife in the pages of a parish register, to ask what reading might have meant to an author who was seemingly incapable of speaking with his own tongue.",75,"WOS:000422838700004",3

"English",,"POLITENESS","From a pragmatic perspective, speech acts can be seen as non-canonical if they reflect perceptions of politeness and face that differ from an accepted norm. This paper traces the canonical or non-canonical status of boasting and apologising in Anglo-Saxon society. The data suggest that boasting developed from a fairly canonical to a more or less non-canonical speech act, depending on the relative influence that Germanic or Christian values had on Anglo-Saxon society. Apologising, on the other hand, was most likely non-canonical in the Anglo-Saxon warrior society since it appears to be incommensurable to the spirit of Germanic heroes. In the context of spreading Christianity, however, acts of penitence (which are here seen as 'pre-apologies') are increasingly advocated as canonical behaviour. Thus, (pre)-apologising (or showing penitence) was on its way from a non-canonical to a canonical status. While the exact development of these two speech acts after Old English has still to be traced in more detail, this article shows that it is the underlying set of ideals and values associated with a society (in this case Germanic self-assertion and retribution and Christian humilitas) that shape the canonical and non-canonical status of expressive speech-acts.",17,"WOS:000411093100005",3

Reversing Monica Flegel's stance in Pets and Domesticity in Victorian Literature and Culture. Animality, Queer Relations and the Victorian Family, in which pet animals are studied through their relationship with the family institution, this paper considers dogs through their radical otherness. It starts from the assumption that literature is where humans can encounter and confront the alterity of animal kind in ways that attempt to move beyond anthropomorphism/centrism. This reversal of perspective, whereby the animal is no longer seen as man's adjunct, is all the more perplexing in the case of dogs, generally described through the tight bond they hold with their masters.

Gabriele D'Annunzio's novel Il piacere (1889) was the only one of these attempts to achieve a truly international reputation. D'Annunzio adopted the cosmopolitan perspective on Rome used by foreign writers, imitating their techniques, in order to present modern Italian literature as part of an international economy of borrowing and exchange, an equal of the literatures of more established European nations such as France and Britain.

The paper argues that, with its emphasis on sense and rhythm, and not dance, Elwood's music effectively communicates the artist's protest against socio-political contradictions in the postcolonial space while sensitizing the masses on the need for change.

Some are very interesting for the jurist analyzing the Tokugawa legal system through the lens of popular culture. This paper examines one of those stories, the tale of a peasant leader whose martyrdom at the hands of an unjust lord - and his return as a ghost - constitute a faithful depiction of the tension between law and justice under the Tokugawa. The story is surprisingly accurate about the description of the procedural system, and the difficulties and risks of bringing legal actions against the nobles are described in detail. Finally, the ghost itself plays a distinctive and important role in the collective imaginary as the agent to correct the defects of a legal system unable to provide justice for the lower strata of the population.",41,"WOS:000403843500007",3

Among these, Storie e leggende is a surprising choice, as Verga himself had declared that this, written in 1875, would not fit into the new medium. By analysing the short story and the film script in a semiotic way, our investigation aims not only to demonstrate that the screenplay offers a new reading of the short story, but also to elucidate why the author decided to adapt the short story for the screen forty years after it was written.

It is a nice story, but it's a myth, a fantasy of empiricism. The modern global health approach did begin with the nineteenth-century, worldwide cholera pandemics, but cartography was not the principal form associated with this paradigm; it was the gothic. Turning back to the mid -nineteenth-century pandemics, this essay explores the contours of an emergent global health approach on both sides of the Atlantic. It demonstrates why the gothic was the form through which this approach was narrated, how the form worked, and the effects of the genre on popular and medical knowledge. Contemporary global health has been reorganized around scientific empiricism, but elements of its gothic history remain.

By allowing the narrator to be revealed as a foppish, neurotically squeamish individual who is both sentimentally romantic and obsessively religious, and by deploying an array of often intricate verbal devices, the author is able to continuously subvert the sinister, pathos-laden and myth-sustaining images of Ukrainian Cossack life and landscape the narrator aspires to create.",38,"WOS:000419408500006",3

But research to date can be found not to have paid enough attention to his transference of the abundant culturally loaded metaphors in the original. A systematic exploration of the transference of these metaphorical expressions may shed new light on the translator and his work. This article draws upon insights from Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Blending Theory to examine three pervasive conceptual metaphor systems in the original novel, namely [BREAST], [ANIMAL], and [CELESTIAL BODY] as the target domains with [HUMAN BEING] as the source domain, and their translations in the English version. These conceptual metaphors, respectively, convey Mo Yan's views on women, the notion of a hometown, and the universe, and the choice of the source domain points to Mo Yan's tendency in conceptual blending to use his Chinese cultural frames. By contrast, in deciphering and representing these metaphors, Goldblatt, while appreciating most of Mo Yan's culturally loaded metaphorical expressions, in some cases provides source domains from his own Western cultural frames, demonstrating his tendency in conceptual blending which develops differently from that of Mo Yan. Besides the cognitive reason why Mo Yan and his translator Goldblatt differ in the manner of conceptual blending, there may be reasons more than misunderstanding of Chinese culture in Goldblatt's choice of translation, among which ideology and cognitive perspective can be said to work together in driving a translator to make choices as what he or she does.",20,"WOS:000422844400005",3

However, they are often embedded in longer exchanges, and within such exchanges individual expressions may or may not have propositional content. This contribution discusses some of the inherent problems of retrieving speech acts, such as greetings and farewells, from a corpus. This is illustrated with a diachronic analysis of greetings and farewells in two hundred years of American English as documented in the 400-million-word Corpus of Historical American English (COHA). In the nineteenth century, the most frequent greetings were good morning and how are you? and the most frequent leave-taking expression was farewell while in Present-day American English the expressions hi and hello dominate as greetings and goodbye and bye bye as leave-taking expressions. The two phrases how do you do? and how are you? serve as examples that show how formulaic and literal uses have coexisted over the entire period covered by COHA, with a shift from a predominance of literal uses to a predominance of formulaic uses, particularly in the case of how do you do?.

That tension leads Roger Casement's official reports on the atrocities committed against rubber gatherers in South America to use provenance as a credible rather than strictly authentic narrative structure for publicizing British investigations of imperial violence. Recognizing provenance as a practice of representation invites reconsideration of Casement's notorious private diaries, which document his sexual interest in large penises.

Over the period of twenty years, Hallyu has evolved from a regional entertainment pop to a global cultural content. The evolution of Hallyu, like any other evolutions, has involved a long process of localization and globalization. Both K-pop and K-dramas, the two major pillars of the Hallyu revolution, are foreign imports. K-pop has mostly been influenced by European and American dance music since the early 1990s, whereas K-dramas have been heavily influenced by Japanese trendy TV dramas in the past, particularly during the 1980s. However, the localization of K-pop and K-dramas by Korean artists, writers, and producers demonstrated their adept rearrangement skills that ushered in a new era of a domestic pop culture boom that had been on the verge of destruction due to Hollywood films, Japanese pop culture contents, and the financial crisis that swept through the nation since 1997. K-pop and K-dramas have successfully gained domestic fame to propagate its commercial influence in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The collection of papers gathered in this Forum Kritika on Hallyu Studies presents their analyses on the process of localizing and globalizing Hallyu, or what I call glocalization. Briefly, glocalization denotes a successful localization of foreign products so much so that original inventors of the products want to import the local variations instead of their originals. Americans buying a massive number of Japanese cars, for example, is a good case of glocalizaiton. Hallyu's glocalization success indicates that the domestic Korean demand for high quality pop culture has induced new types of competition that required importing global pop content, simultaneously requiring them to contrive to produce better quality pop content than the originals for re-exporting to foreign markets, given the enormous investments that cannot be recouped from a small Korean market.",17,"WOS:000409131200007",3

Nowadays, much social and academic attention is being paid to the reason for the success of K-pop.

For this, diachronic perspectives are applied to analyze the formation and development of gwangdae culture and K-pop; and the cultural hybridity theories are used in explaining the succession of gwangdae spirit to K-pop culture. As a result, this study examines how and what kinds of changes and innovations Korean gwangdae culture has gone through to accumulate, pass down and develop the gwangdae's artistic and cultural capabilities, living up to the demands of the times, since earlier times. Thus, this study tries to understand the meaning through traditional interpretation and reflections on K-pop and also makes specific policy recommendations to accompany the analysis.

"English",,,"Hebrew literary culture in the early twentieth century relied as much on the translation of ""great books"" of world literature as it did on the production of original Hebrew works. Knut Hamsun's Norwegian novel Markens grode, translated into Hebrew as Birkat ha-adamah by Nissan Touroff for Stybel Press in 1921, was one of many such books. However, partly because its themes resonate deeply with Labor Zionist ideology, Birkat ha-adamah held a special place in the Yishuv. Touroff's translation conveys the universality of Hamsun's Romantic ideas about proximity to nature and agricultural settlement, but also forges a particular link to Zionism: certain translation choices suggest that Touroff restores an absent biblical original through his Hebrew. In this essay, I argue that Touroff recalibrates the sacrality of Hamsun's novel to accommodate the spiritual and ideological needs of the Zionists in the Yishuv. Enhancing existing biblical intertexts to posit the novel as an alternative Zionist sacred text, his translation and its reception expose a fertile tension between universal ideals and specifically Zionist concerns. Translation of ""great books"" helped bring the world to Hebrew; the production of original Hebrew works helped bring Hebrew to the world. Birkat ha-adamah's productive grappling between the world and the Yishuv, though, reveals another dimension in this seemingly straightforward cultural economy.",36,"WOS:000419357700005",3

Focusing on this novel, which fictionalizes the author's own experience of Melbourne's Presbyterian Ladies' College from 1883 to 1887, this article considers her representation of girls as not just objects but agents of disciplinary action. I argue that in boarding school, novels such as Richardson's discipline functions laterally, between peers, in ways that often reiterate the 'vertical' authority of parents and teachers but also contest it, moving into the space created by its failures or absences. Reading these novels thus requires a re-orientation of our own theoretical models for thinking about discipline, in particular, the Foucauldian panopticon and his conception of the segmented space of the school, which do not allow for the kinds of sideways glances that proliferate across Richardson's novel. The Getting of Wisdom thus provides the opportunity to theorize anew the role played by the peer group in shaping girls into social subjects, a role that was a cause for both celebration and concern by commentators of the time.",34,"WOS:000414003400006",3

We investigate the origins of local knowledge by studying the work practices of scouts in two comparative global trades: fashion modelling and football. Based on ethnographic and interview data, we find that scouts depend upon local knowledge at both the periphery and the core of their trade networks. To source local knowledge, they engage in two key activities. The first is 'relational work', the bridging of physical distances across networks by building ties with potential exchange partners. Scouts also engage in 'recognition work' as they hone expertise to identify raw skill in remote locations and match it to shifting trends at the networks' core. This study finds that distinct forms of relational and recognition work are employed to identify and source local knowledge at the network's periphery and core. We conclude that given the centrality of sourcing local knowledge, scouts will remain central in global commerce. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.",32,"WOS:000403127300001",3

Six years later, literary critics, doctors, and environmentalists are still considering the powerful and pervasive material forces of toxins and pollution and their increasingly harmful effects on the human body. This topic was first introduced by Joni Adamson in a monograph that signaled a turn in ecocriticism to environmental justice that considered toxins and pollution in the places we live, work, and play (2001).

Drawing on the perspectives of elemental/material ecocriticism in relation to disease, the environment, and bodies, this essay explores Terry Tempest Williams's Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place (1991) to analyze how nuclear detonation, underground, was constitutive of the history of what she terms the ""clan of the one-breasted women."" After emphasizing the possible (environmental) causes and risks of cancer or other chronic diseases in the age of the Anthropocene, the essay then focuses on attempts to uncover the ""underground"" or alternative epistemologies of cancer and other diseases and their associated therapies based on a reading of Victoria Sweet's book God's Hotel: A Doctor, a Hospital, and a Pilgrimage to the Heart of Medicine (2012). Sweet's professional experience acquired over twenty years of practice as a doctor at Laguna Honda, a chronic care hospital, resonates with the perspectives of other authors who are also interested in alternative and ecological health care and in notions of ""slow medicine,"" ""ecological medicine,"" the art of gardening, and mind-body interactions. In the framework of elemental ecocriticism, this essay argues that in picturing an era of anthropogenic culture and confronting invisible xenobiotic chemicals, Sweet's elemental ecocritical thinking of medicine, bodies, and environment is not obsolete but perhaps an ""antidote"" to the suicidal tendency of modern society.",20,"WOS:000414980500005",3
"English",,,"How do you read a serial narrative that has been published daily for over eighty years? On the pages of the daily newspaper, yet taking place within an eternal present, the classic comic Blondie (1930-) currently exists in a moment of suspended animation in which a narratological apocalypse has taken place, roughly coinciding with the death of Chic Young, the comic's creator. Drawing from archival research in the Don Ault Collections at the University of Florida library, I periodize Blondie, one of the longest running yet almost universally ignored comic strips that has been published on a daily basis since 1930. From characters who mysteriously vanished from the strip following the invention of the Gallup poll to the brief era when the Bumsteads became the official spokespersons for American nuclear energy (the reassuringly nuclear family deployed to present a family-friendly fantasy of nuclear fission) to the celebration of Blondie's 75th anniversary that was faced with the peculiar problem of figuring out how to historicize 75 years without displacing the strip from its universal present, I chart how history has been deliberately repressed in the comic. Although each strip is designed as ephemeral, repetitive, and throwaway, the comic has proved to be as durable as its individual iterations are expendable. The labor and reproduction represented in the comic itself as well as the rehearsal of the same gags revolving around the Taylorized rhythm of work and family life, create an interconnected feedback loop between form and content-between the industrial modes of reproduction of the newspaper and the culture of bourgeois capitalism.",22,"WOS:000418348000005",3

The public retrievability of the iconic red and pink ribbons followed very different paths: red ribbons rose rapidly and fell out of favor just as quickly, whereas the presence of the pink ribbon grew steadily over time. What explains these different trajectories? We identify and explain these differences through an analysis of archival newspaper data from 1991 to 2014 and through the use of secondary sources to create case studies of important moments in the histories of these symbols. The paper makes three interventions. 1) It elaborates and extends Schudson's (1989) discussion of cultural power, refining the mechanism of retrievability and adding recognizability. 2) It demonstrates the importance of organizations in maintaining high retrievability and recognizability in the face of criticism and controversy, along with politicians, celebrities, and corporations. 3) It introduces ""genre violation"" as a mechanism undermining a symbol's cultural power.

Its intent is to destabilize the state's policies on racial privileging and political suppression, to create a space for free discourse, and to advocate a pluralistic Malaysia. To do so, however, requires a social movement organization to espouse a frame of action that fuses performance and commentary, and to support this work by building and mobilizing resources, among them networks, financial resources, and political leverage. But the Five Arts Centre's focus, since its founding in 1983, largely remains with the Malaysian middle class.

While we can imagine the modern period as an era shaped in relation to fossil fuels, the outcome of this periodization is different than we might think.

"English",,"NIGERIA; PATRONAGE; GOD","Hubert Ogunde's little-known 1945 opera Strike and Hunger provides a unique opportunity to examine the ways in which late colonial politics were reimagined in drama. Strike and Hunger was inspired by the 1945 General Strike in Lagos and offers an allegorical dramatization of these events. This article will suggest that we move beyond previous accounts of the opera, which understood Strike and Hunger as emblematizing nationalist resistance to colonialism, and will instead argue that the opera's account of colonial rule was grounded in an ethics of reciprocity. It will demonstrate that Ogunde's opera reconstructs the strike in terms of the failure of Qba Yejide to redistribute resources to his subjects. The central concern of the opera is the quest to restore the supply of food and end hunger. This account of hunger is at one level a literal description of the food shortages of the strike, but it can also be read metonymically as representing the flow and exchange of resources that define status in Yoruba culture. The Oba's dishonorable failure to redistribute resources leads to a crisis in which he accumulates resources, but his subjects starve. Ogunde's critique of the colonial government is epitomized not in terms of a nationalist resistance to colonial rule, but in attempts by Yejide subjects to remake their unwanted and foreign Qba in their own image. Together, they succeed in teaching Yejide how to be a patron or a ""big man.""",53,"WOS:000404162900012",3
"English",,,"Huizinga was a readers' writer, and as such part of a long tradition. As a writer, he was a member of a relatively small philological circle, consisting of the readers in the most important languages of Ancient Europe, and in this way the re-creators of the ancient unity of the Latinitas from which colloquial Latin had originated. These readers were forced to acknowledge that that which had once split into different languages was now disintegrating further as a result of specialization. One of the most important branches of this family was Romanic philology in Germany, with Friedrich Christian Dietz and Leopold von Ranke as its founding fathers. It blossomed at the beginning of the 20th century with scholars such as Vossler, Curtius, Spitzer and Auerbach. In my contribution I will concentrate on Leo Spitzer. I will focus on four things he had in common with Huizinga: an assumption, an experience, an analysis and a tool. Their assumption was that culture was defined by harmony, by the unity and inseparability of the hearts and minds of its participants. This unity gave a culture its metaphysical aura; it was a musical harmony of the individual soul with the cosmos.

Specifically, researchers have been claiming for the humanities frames and concepts from the sciences, such as the humanities labs that signal (in both name and design) quantifiability, verifiability and functionality.

Given these parallels, why do the two narratives end so differently, with a quiet death in the Flaubert and a violent one in the Rodenbach? Donald Winnicott's theory of transitional objects enables an answer to this question. Flaubert's protagonist has a successful transitional object, the parrot Loulou, where Rodenbach's has a failed object in the form of his dead wife's golden braid, and the roles of these two objects help to explain the two works' conclusions. A transitional object reading further allows comparison of the texts' representation of religion, both the private shrines of the characters and the public processions of their communities. The distinction between successful and failed transitional objects is tied to the public/private opposition. Felicite, in Un cOEur simple, and Hugues, in Bruges-la-morte, differ from each other in their respective attachments to public and private life, notably in the religious sphere.

From this perspective, foodways provide spatiotemporal continuity while revealing the historical foundations of culture produced during the everyday interactions of cooking and eating.

The (semi)automatic method uses the recently created Historic Thesaurus Semantic Tagger (HTST) to search for meaning constellations (Archer and Malory 2017).

Biographical critics have seen in their rivalry a reflection of the author's relations with his brother William. This essay is more interested in the clothes, and the fears and desires to which they give rise. The sisters' antagonism provides the model for a debate that runs through James's thinking about property, legacy and memory: on the one hand a dream of total control, on the other of wholesale dispersal. If the violence with which this early tale ends is unusual for James, the threat of it is never absent, and this is a key to the way Shakespeare works in his imagination, that he is often associated with injury, especially in Othello and Hamlet. Shakespeare's words are themselves the matter of memory, collective and personal, for James and his readers. James's extraordinary late essay. on The Tempest serves to draw together the main strands of the argument, before a final glancing comparison between the legacies that Shakespeare and James appeared to leave in 1916, on the latter's death, and the tercentenary of the former's.",32,"WOS:000404077600004",3

Ulysses, if added to Lodge's literary canon, fills a gap (in terms of style and content) between Lodge's earlier work and what some critics view as his finest prose pamphlet, the streetwise satire, Wits Miserie, and the World's Madnesse.

This paper examines Wesley's sermon within the context of his support for the Societies for the Reformation of Manners. It argues that Wesley employs a rhetoric of shame to admonish both the sinner who is the subject of the sermon, but also the parish community which had tolerated her immorality in its midst, thus rendering it complicit. The Reformation of Manners movement required informants to report vice to the authorities, and Wesley's parishioners had fallen short in this respect. Yet Wesley's stance as a moral reformer was not unproblematic. On the second occasion of preaching the sermon, his daughter had eloped and, abandoned by her lover, had recently returned to an unforgiving family.

"English","Comedie-Francaise; French language; theatre censorship; national theatre; Britishness","THEATER","In 1879, theatre critic Augustin Filon stated on account of the French company's second visit to London that year, 'les voyages de la Comedie-Francaise sont regardes en Angleterre comme des dates'. Upon receiving the troupe, renowned actor Henry Irving praised the success of French actors, such as Got, Mounet-Sully, Coquelin dine and cadet, and Sarah Bernhardt on the Gaiety Theatre stage in London. Their performance in their native tongue proved to be an aesthetic magnificence that had clearly captivated an essentially English-speaking audience: 'the pictures they produced went straight to the heart and needed no language for those of us who could not master French', Irving declared. Indeed, performances in the original linguistic version were sure to garner critical acclaim. British actor and theatre director Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree would also chime in to eulogize the prosodic qualities of the language of Moliere, contrasting it with the British tradition as follows: 'what a perennial delight is in hearing the French language spoken !... How blunt and heavy an old instrument, in comparison, English seems !' For their powerful oratory and elocution on stage, the French, he concluded, were 'a naturally expressive race'. This study aims to analyse the impact of the Comedie-Francaise in Victorian England by focusing on the company's visits to London in 1871, 1879 and 1893. Although their repertoire (which included works by Moliere, Racine, Corneille, Alfred de Musset, Alexandre Dumas fils, and Emile Augier) was completely performed in French, the company was commended by audiences as much as it was lauded by British professional peers, for whom it represented the ultimate expression of high art. Through an examination of the reviews and impressions published by an array of professionals, including leading theatre critics at the time, dramatists, actors and aficionados, the research analyses the sociological, political, and aesthetic implications associated with the firm presence of the French language and French canonical plays in late Victorian London. The responses of theatre professionals inevitably raise the matter of high art by implicitly questioning which of the two theatrical traditions best reflect and recreate, through their language, such cultural standards: How is a language stylized to answer simultaneously to dramatic conventions and to expectations related to national sentiment? To what extent could French phonetics and prosody be regarded as a sociocultural referent accessible only to an elite audience? Did the Lord Chamberlain subject the plays in French to the same censorship procedures and vigilance as those in English? By posing these and other related matters, the work argues that the debate on the superiority of French or English as theatrical languages is inevitably bound to the ever-fluctuating issue of Britishness. Theatre being a fundamental pillar of national identity (while also an indispensable conduit for questioning political order and structures), the traditional rivalry between French and British culture could not have found a better setting in which to compete for aesthetic and rhetorical excellence than the London stage.",52,"WOS:000422974900009",3
"English",,,"In 1892 the celebrated physicist and chemist William Crookes commented on the existence of an almost infinite range of ethereal vibrations or electrical rays, which he believed could revolutionize telegraphic communications (174). A few years later, and aided by Crookes's experiments with vacuums, the German physicist Wilhelm Rontgen successfully produced X-rays, a hitherto unrecorded form of electromagnetic radiation, which he tantalizingly described as a new kind of invisible light (Rontgen 413; Warner 256). Crookes was quick to speculate as to the possibility of links between roentgen rays and the cerebral ganglia, that an undiscovered organ in the brain might be capable of transmitting and receiving...electrical rays (Lyons 105; Crookes 176). X-rays, he thought, might prove a psychic counterpart to higher wavelength radio waves, allowing the transmission of messages telepathically rather than telegraphically, and even communication with the world of the spirits (Lyons 105). Crookes theorized that the parapsychological was intimately entwined with the findings of contemporary physics, occupying different zones of the same electromagnetic spectrum. An ardent Spiritualist, he believed that the ether, the impalpable, invisible entity, by which all space is supposed to be filled and which contained countless channels of communication also sustained ghost-light...invisible to the naked eye and acted as a medium that allowed ethereal bodies to rise up (Crookes 174; Warner 253-56). In other words, the matter through which light and electrical signals passed was envisaged as the same substance which allowed the spirits to fluctuate between visible and invisible forms. These links between the electromagnetic field and the occult, endorsed by Crookes and certain other members of his circles such as the Society for Psychical Research, anticipated turn-of-the-century associations between electricity, radiation and ancient Egypt which, through its reputation as the birthplace of magic, was central to Victorian conceptions of the supernatural.",62,"WOS:000395430200007",3

This dramatic shift - from perceiving India as an opportunity to perceiving it as a threat - is attributable to the influence of Charles Pearson's National Life and Character (1894) which warned of the end of white hegemony if white men began mixing with the Chinese, 'Hindoo' and 'Negro' races. Pearson's work questioned the assumption that white men were born to rule, advocating the preservation of 'white men's countries' to maintain white supremacy for as long as possible.

When his sister is raped and kidnapped, he appeals to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who swiftly takes up his case and helps him secure the conviction of the reservation superintendent in federal court. Massacre (1934) received little public attention upon its release. In the decades since, it has gone unexamined by scholars, aside from a few production studies that have pointed to the effects of New Deal ideology and Hays Office censorship in manufacturing the film's simplistically triumphant conclusion. So far, no scholar has undertaken an adaptation studies approach to determine precisely how much of the book's anti-government criticism the film retains. While its ending diverges from Gessner's conclusion that the government remained unresponsive to Native Americans' pleas for justice, this should not eclipse the ways in which Massacre boldly conveys the author's unprecedented attack on the starvation, extortion, disease, and physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by the federal government's Bureau of Indian Affairs.",28,"WOS:000417299000004",3

Although this hypothesis was deemed credible for a number of years, it is now thought to be unlikely that the painting inspired the poem or that the poem is an instance of ekphrasis.

This turn to the juridical opens a space for further critical reflection on Malabou's thinking. Through a reading of Jose Saramago's novel Seeing we can displace Malabou's insistence on the centrality of cerebral life in her effort to deconstruct the symbolic/biological binary and instead gesture towards a collective and affective life that remains refractory in relation to the juridical forms that sovereignty seeks to impose.

"English","visual metaphor; asymmetry; context; interaction; juxtaposition","SIMILARITY; REPRESENTATION","In a verbal metaphor, the target and the source domains can usually be distinguished clearly, and some features of the source domain are mapped to the target domain, and not vice versa. This asymmetry of metaphor has been acknowledged in conceptual metaphor theory, as well as in interaction theory. However, the asymmetry of visual metaphor, in which concepts are depicted in images, is debated in the existing literature. The authors argue that the main reason behind this is that images lack an explicit copula (""X is Y""); so it is not always clear what a visual metaphor is about (what its target is). The authors explore the asymmetry of visual metaphors by considering a number of examples, and also by using the results of an empirical study they conducted with forty-four participants. Their study shows that, although the source and the target of visual metaphors are reversible more often than in their verbal counterparts, the transferred features usually change drastically by the reversal. This essay argues that the visual metaphors can appear to be symmetric more often than the verbal metaphors because the lack of copula can turn the focus on the comparison between the source and the target, instead of the target itself. The examples demonstrate that context plays a major role in this process by identifying the source and the target of a visual metaphor.",43,"WOS:000393270200005",3

This discord manifests in Nuran's maternal duty to protect her daughter Fatma, who also bears the inheritance and emerges as Mumtaz's main rival for Nuran's affections.

The acquisitive ideology and inequality in material possession breed fear politics and allow the citizens' alarmed perception of insecurity to affect social justice. Residential differentiation, invalidation of public space, stigmatization, and physical violence are the specific representations. However, as fear politics leaves the root of danger and crime untouched, its effectiveness seems doubtable.

Yet it does not merely reflect or represent a secular regime as it has developed outside the world of the poem; rather, it labors to articulate an uncertain, yet recognizably Jewish, sensibility of the secular. This sensibility should be understood in the context of the poet's broader concerns with the modern significance of biblical and post-biblical Judaism, concerns that can be read in the very cycle of which ""Kaddish"" is the conclusion, the 1941 ""Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down."" In addition, George Oppen's own poem in memory of Charles Reznikoff enables us to identify an aesthetics of the humble that, intertwined with an ethics of humility, is distinctive of Reznikoff 's work, and that leads to the conclusion that the secular sensibility in ""Kaddish"" amounts to more than a simple act of negation, a simple disregard or scorn for the trappings of traditional ritual.",14,"WOS:000395856400004",3

This paper explores David Jones's interest in the tenth-century Vercelli Book poem The Dream of the Rood and its wider tradition, and brings new knowledge from Anglo-Saxon Studies to bear on Jones's late modernist poem, The Anathemata (1952). Drawing on archival research from The Library of David Jones, National Library of Wales, this paper argues that Jones's poetic reworking of The Dream of the Rood in visual and verbal media offers a perceptive and informed response to the liturgical and vernacular contexts that may have produced The Dream of the Rood in the tenth century Although discussions of Jones's use of The Dream of the Rood often focus upon the image of the sacrificial cross and the trope of the Miles Christi, this paper suggests that Jones's interest lay in how the poem might be seen to respond to the multisensory and performative dimensions of the Christian liturgy. Jones saw The Dream of the Rood, like the liturgy, as a ""visual and aural liaison with the formative things of this island and of the religion-culture of the entire West."" Such insight can help us to reread both Jones's 1952 poem and the Old English Dream of the Rood within the context of their respective liturgical and literary cultures.",32,"WOS:000445976300010",3

The most ""visceral"" and rancorous response, rationalizing his ""minimal"" Jewish involvement, came from Lionel Trilling. The fact that Trilling, nearing age forty, responded at all and responded so viscerally seemed out of character. Trilling in his writing and persona was known as gracious, reserved, balanced. He had barely addressed Jewish concerns since 1931. As the author of acclaimed works on Matthew Arnold and E. M.

This essay will try to explain the disparity between what Trilling seemed to be in 1944 and how he responded. To do so, it will analyze the long-fuse to Trilling's 1944 outburst and then the outburst itself.

Sangra por la herida functions best as a narrative that juxtaposes a dystopic vision of several neighborhoods in the city, with multiple narrative voices, mostly female, depicting the everyday experience of people surviving in Habana del Este, Vedado, and Alamar. The novel allows the detective format to recover the memory of Cuba's utopian dreams of the early 1960s, a period that, according to the novel, was already showing signs of corrupting those dreams. The novel structures its narrative around the unsolved crimes against two women, yet the author is ultimately concerned with the disintegration of popular memory around violence to women during the last decades of the twentieth century.

The author aims to reveal the gender divide associated to clothing through a comparative approach towards popular literature in Spanish and English. She uses Judith Butler's theory of performative acts in order to conduct the text analysis. Clothes-related acts feature prominently in the case of popular balladry. Spanish ""romances"" and Anglo-American ballads are poems that were and are still meant to be orally performed. Therefore, the audience plays a key role on transmission and retransmission, which in turn shape societal mores. The discussion shows how certain gender-associated topics have been left intact, particularly the bias against women's vanity. The conclusions that are set forward will hopefully be of use to the literary reader-scholar who is interested in new ways of looking at oral traditions of different languages and nations, sharing a common European background.",53,"WOS:000409222300004",3

In the 1920s and 1930s, a plurality of views on China and the Chinese people became widespread across different parts of Europe, mainly shaped by English, French, and German representations. Contradictory images of China coexisted in literature, thought, and popular culture. Crespi's work exemplifies these contradictions: China appears as both an attainable reality and an unreachable fantasy, two tropes that prevailed in Catalan society after having been adapted from the European imagery. The novel responds to these contradictory discourses by launching a radical critique of Western modernity imposed on China. This article argues that representing China from Catalonia (or from the rest of Spain) not only implied the import of data and knowledge from European sources but also the transculturation of formal aspects and a subordination of agency. By showing how difficult it was to imagine China from the periphery of Europe without the mediation of these European centers, this article rethinks the politics of cross-cultural circulation in a noncolonizer, noncolonized context.",42,"WOS:000409222300005",3

The Chinese edition aims more at how Crusoe's story should be understood primarily as a material for drawing traditional moral lessons, whereas the American edition treats it more as a reading material to develop student's reading and writing skills.

Second, it explores how memory plays a dual function of deception and decoration. That is to say, Christopher deliberately uses his memory to create positive images of female characters and to build up negative images of male characters, which makes both of them look deceptively true.

In 1970, Buyens received a positive funding recommendation for Top-Hit Girl, a satire about community difficulties in Belgium. However, Minister of Culture Frans van Mechelen refused to support the project because it conflicted with his pro-Flemish views. The minister successfully swept this controversial decision under the rug by offering Buyens the option to trade his socially critical project for a film adaptation of Willem Elsschot's novel Will-O'-the Wisp. This case study sheds new light on an understudied period in Belgian cinema and on the work of Frans Buyens. It demonstrates how the Flemish cinema landscape could be heavily influenced by political ideologies and interventions. Political maneuvers ensured that a satirical treatment of Belgian community difficulties in cinema was suppressed.

This article focuses on one site for these encounters: the character of Millat Iqbal, who joins a gang of teenagers and subsequently a radical Islamic group in his problematic search for identity and belonging. This search is characterized by Millat's tendency to define himself by reference to well-known pop-cultural Mafia figures, whom he admires. This article argues that, in their attention to Mafia narratives in film and television rather than to actual Italian diaspora, these Mafia references are representative of Smith's portrayal of multicultural space.

In 1787 Edmond Malone took this to be an accusation of plagiarism, and used it to justify his theory that Greene had written the unauthorized Quartos, The First Part of the Contention (1594) and The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of York (1595), and that Shakespeare 'new-modelled and amplified these two pieces' to create what the 1623 Folio calls The Second and Third Part of King Henry VI, without acknowledging his debt, thus arousing Greene's anger. Malone had no evidence for this theory, and it was comprehensively demolished by Peter Alexander in 1929 and by H. O. White in 1935. Despite their work, John Dover Wilson revived Malone's theory in 1951, and it continues to produce claims that Shakespeare was a plagiarist.

In the section on. Physiological Colours' the eye is shown to respond to any strong stimulus with a complementary and opposite reaction. There is therefore a systematic relation between colours - blue opposed to yellow, red to green - which can be represented as a circle. Colours are not qualities of objects, but experiences of an observer in time. In his second section, on. Physical Colours', Goethe aims to show that Newton's prismatic experiments, which treat colour as an object, are secondary variations of such subjective experiences. That subjective element cannot be eliminated from colour, which is therefore a 'primary phenomenon', an 'Urphanomen', not susceptible of further explanation. The appendix on.

"English","indenture; slavery; retrospective realism; historical novel; global plantation complex",,"In his novel Sea of Poppies, Indian writer Amitav Ghosh emphasizes the fact that while the indentured laborer was not a slave per se, the indenture of South Asian laborers developed in the belly of plantation slavery. Without conflating the categories of slavery and indenture, the novel demonstrates that the indentured laborer's decision to ""accept"" indenture was prompted by the need to survive within a world of shrinking options for the Indian peasantry rather than a desire for personal mobility. Indeed, the Indian peasant-turned-indentured laborer faced a lack of choice, which, while not equivalent to the forced abduction of the African slave, must nonetheless be studied alongside it within an overarching framework of the epistemic and material violence of nineteenth-century global capitalist-imperialist formations. In other words, the novel highlights the inadequacy of applying the binary of freedom and bondage characteristic of the discourse of chattel slavery directly to the narrative of indentured labor. Through his portrayal of the decommissioned slave ship as a central metaphor of capitalist modernity, around and within which all the social relationships of the novel circulate, Ghosh represents indenture as a form of ""decommissioned slavery"" This reading interrogates our understanding of both ""choice"" and ""coercion,"" enabling us to re-examine the blurred lines between these two categories in a global economy characterized by the structural transformations of plantation slavery and territorial colonialism.

Bacon pioneered a form of aphoristic writing that was designed to help empiricists access nature by avoiding psychological pitfalls.

Further, a nuanced definition of the trope will provide insights into Mathilde's attempt to bridge the gap between the nobility and the working class. The essay concludes that Julien Sorel's death leaves many loose ends, and that his character is an embodiment of the ambiguity in the anacoluthon.",17,"WOS:000403574900004",3

The ordering of these letters is not adequately explained by comparing the dates of birth or death of the two thinkers. For the Letter on Locke not only precedes but also 'frames' those on Newton, in the sense that it provides the reader with a guide through the philosophical intricacies of Letters XIV-XVII. This works in two ways. On the one hand, in order to defend Newton against his detractors Voltaire broadly adopts Locke's perspective on the relation among words, ideas and things. On the other hand, he subtly and misleadingly grafts Locke's epistemology onto the Principia, though it differs from Newton's epistemology in significant respects. For Locke, unlike Newton, holds that we can identify fixed, permanent limits concerning what kind of thing humanity can know of matter and the universe. Voltaire presents Newton's ideas as though they respected Locke's limits. However, we can glimpse Voltaire's own attitude in the final words of Letter XV: 'Procedes huc, et non ibis amplius': Voltaire agrees more closely with Locke than Newton concerning the limits of epistemology.",18,"WOS:000392292700002",3

"English",,,"In many of Margaret Atwood's stories, neither love nor money makes the world or, rather, the plot go round. The prime interest and profit for her offended protagonists often derives from a satisfactorily accomplished revenge. The ancient law of talion, of an-eye-for-an-eye, presides over these stories. This paper explores the two main responses to injury and aggression that correspond to the chronological trajectory of Atwood's writings. In her early short fiction, retaliatory drives are typically directed inward. The (mainly female) victims tend to punish themselves rather than their aggressors. In the later fiction, by contrast, outer-directed reprisal becomes the reactive rule. As selected instances will show, Atwood's human and nonhuman avengers, including nature itself, increasingly find varied ways to strike back at offenders.",42,"WOS:000424834600003",3
"English",,"VICTORIAN-ENGLAND; INVESTMENT","In May 1855, Charles Dickens confided to a friend that he had found a capital name for his new work, Nobody's Fault, a title that remained until he completed the first three numbers and renamed it Little Dorrit (Letters 7.703). The original title has generally been assumed to refer to Dickens's broad attack on the lack of accountability in government, particularly in relation to the Crimean War. However, the phrase also evokes the issues of financial impropriety that permeate the novel. In particular, Arthur's obsessive concern that through his parents' grasping at money some one may have been grievously deceived, injured, ruined (39; bk. 1, ch.5) links his personal sense of guilt to the more public instance of financial ruin in the book - the collapse of Mr. Merdle's fraudulent schemes. In both cases, the question of agency remains ambiguous. Who is at fault for the bankruptcy of Clennam & Doyce: Arthur, who invested the firm's money in Merdle's ventures; Pancks, who convinced him of their soundness; or Merdle, who perpetrated the fraud? And who bears responsibility for the financial deceit that deprived Amy Dorrit of her rightful inheritance from Arthur's grandfather: Mrs. Clennam, who hid the codicil; Arthur's father, who colluded in the concealment; or Arthur, who, along with his parents, benefited financially from the transaction? Out of these ambiguities emerges one figure that becomes the locus of responsibility and blame for both transgressions - Arthur Clennam. Against the express wishes of his solicitor, Arthur steps forward to become the solitary target for the thousands of people... wildly staring about for somebody alive to heap reproaches on in the aftermath of Merdle's downfall and suicide (599; bk. 2, ch.26). His actions give public expression to his private sense of familial guilt, allowing him to declare openly, I am at fault.",43,"WOS:000400962200010",3

"English",,,"In Memento Mori, Muriel Spark renders the artifacts and practice of memento mori in the tangible form of telephone calls from what seems to be death itself. In so doing, it explores the array of possible responses to reminders of mortality, often to comic effect. The novel combines comedy with the uncanny - not only through the supernatural, but also through the impossibility of solving the mystery of these calls, as well as in the encounter with the looming experience of death. The uncanny has the effect of generating simultaneous attraction and dread; adding a comic layer to the eeriness deepens the charge of this contrast. This binary of attraction and repulsion, along with the novel's many others' binaries, such as the seen/unseen and life/death, does not flatten the dichotomies but rather shows how intertwined apparent opposites can be: how the mysterious and the known inevitably interpenetrate each other. The encounters with death and mystery invite readers to reflect upon how best to live within the constraints of human experience, or be the implied objects of the novel's biting comic critique.",27,"WOS:000416179500008",3

It is utilized as a sort of normative account of its epistemic implication foregrounding lying's problematization. Here Eco addresses the very duality of lying that is intertwined with the authenticity of language, and journalism is the ideal genre to tackle this problem. A lie is intrinsically linguistic and essentially semiotic because, at a material expression level and an immaterial content level, language violates the principle of non-contradiction since it is and it is not at the same time and in the same respect, due to the dualistic nature of signs that work toward the creation of meaning. It is because it is endowed with the ability to refer; it is not because it is never a true self, it lacks its own individuality. Thus, as a communicative/significative medium, language foresees and legitimizes the paradoxical duality between lie and truth insofar as it always requires the presence of the other; it requires the coexistence of the one (expression level) and the other (content level) to ultimately produce meaning.

As the play progresses, the protagonist not only becomes a symbol of perceived injustice for the Nigerian and international media, it also transpires that the woman has been interpellated, and actively participates, in a system based on gender inequality and religious bigotry. Drawing on both the dramatic and the theatrical text of the play, this article examines different dimensions of ""Islam"" as contained, imagined, and staged in Hagel auf Zamfara; it also pays attention to gendered roles, violence, perceptions of justice, and the role of fantasy.

Here we characterize the relationship between Jewish literature and world literature in terms of the ""nonuniversal global"": our term for the paradoxical condition of a global diaspora that is at once cosmopolitan and marked by its minority status. We draw upon the eight essays included in the issue to interrogate the relationship between World Literature and Jewish culture by focusing on how different modern Jewish writers understood the significance of ""the world"" in the context of their literary practice. Adducing the work of our contributors, we demonstrate how modern Jewish writing in sites across the globe and in a range of economic and political systems emerged asking questions of its own world status and its tranlatability.

This essay argues that authorial narration plays a more prominent role in The Ambassadors than has previously been recognized and that the narrator's efforts to read and describe Strether's consciousness parallel Strether's own interpretive activity. Even during instances of free indirect discourse (FID), the narrator of The Ambassadors is a consistent presence, describing Strether's consciousness in precise, evocative detail and modeling for the reader a posture of careful and responsive attention to otherness. (In this respect, the essay's argument about narration bears on one of the central conceptual questions in the theory of FID that is, whether the two subjectivities [narratorial and figural] evoked by FID coexist, with the figural subjectivity contained or framed by the subjectivity of the narrator or whether, instead, narratorial subjectivity simply disappears in FID, replaced or superseded by figural subjectivity) Finally, The Ambassadors is a sustained exercise in reading reading the subtle grammar of the Jamesian sentence, reading delicate shifts in subjectivity or reference, reading the suggestions and intonations in dialogue and its subject matter is Strether's reading of the characters around him and his own cognition and perception. The novel's narrative technique mirrors this preoccupation with reading and with the ethical implications of reading by incorporating the perspective of an attentive external reader or observer into the text, in the presence of the narrator.",30,"WOS:000390973900002",3

This is exploited by the author, who quotes the Psalms on at least seventy-seven occasions, twice as much as any other scriptural book. When quoting the Psalms across the work the author does not normally translate the Latin, but when he does it is usually with the purpose of developing allegorical and moral glosses on the Psalter text. In this way, the author's use of the Psalms in the other books of his treatise both draws on the anchoresses' liturgical reading and simultaneously enhances it by offering deeper meanings to texts which they repeatedly read.

This presents an opportunity to reframe the debate over the novel: the chief question is not whether the ghosts are real but whether the children desire (and are responsible for) collusion with ghosts (real or not).

As a result, while the linguistic analysis of historical texts can be rigorously systematic and corpus-based, the visual data, when taken into account at all, have typically been rather scarce and anecdotal in nature. In this paper, I will discuss new computational methods of analysing diachronic changes in visual features of title-pages and body text, and of combining that information with linguistic data.

In response, a growing corpus of fiction and scholarship has sought to give voice to the complexities of life in contemporary South African cityscapes.

Beukes explores the stakes of the novelist's own appropriation of suffering in a way that is markedly rare for thrillers. Through conspicuous silences, Zoo City calls attention to the invisibility of many forms of precarity and efforts to claim autonomy in Hillbrow. The novel simultaneously offers and destabilizes a sense of privileged knowledge that transcends mainstream media representations.

To verify whether responses to poetry are universal or culture specific, a rigorous method was adopted: 500 humanities undergraduate students from two different countries (Brazil and Ukraine) were asked to read Poe's ""The Lake"" and to gauge their reactions using a questionnaire with a fifteen-item semantic differential scale. Participants read either the original version in English (i.e., a foreign language to them) or its translation into their mother tongue (Portuguese, Russian, or Ukrainian).

Despite the benefits for the linguistic, sociolinguistic, and cultural self-esteem and empowerment of Spanish HLL, one of the main challenges and limitations that has been identified in SL courses is the reinforcement of critical attitudes about the Latino community and the resilience of standard language ideologies. The goal of this study was to explore the ways Spanish HLL interact with language issues in their own community and to examine how students negotiate the critical perspective of language acquired in the classroom with language ideologies generally assumed and expressed by the community.",34,"WOS:000411169300003",3

"English","Oriental; Subaltern; Justice; Cogito; Subjectivity; Storytelling",,"In response to the contemporary American philosopher Michael J. Sandel's tremendous popularity and ongoing engagements with Chinese philosophy, which are often offered as evidence of a deep resonance between his work and contemporary Chinese interests in justice, I argue that his conception of justice as a product of the storyteller's narrative quest encounters two potential problems when considered from a Chinese perspective. The first is whether ""Chinese"" justice-which can be viewed substantially as a collective if not individual attempt to overcome subalternity as the Oriental subject-can be achieved through the foreign forms of moral reasoning that are perhaps guilty of consigning Chinese to their status as Orientals in the first place. The second questions whether the Western culture of storytelling, of the heroic subject who conquers the other (so often the Oriental in modern times), is not already a product and producer of injustice, and in its contemporary forms, a fantasy and fetish of capitalist society that is not only incapable of individual justice, but also complicit in injustices towards others. These points are raised in tandem with discussions of ongoing generational shifts in China largely attributable to the rapid expansion of a market economy and the growing normalization of Western-style heroic, justice seeking storyteller, which might in turn legitimize Sandel's approach to justice. However, from a Marxist perspective, I argue that such developments might be Trojan horses for new forms of subjugation, alienation, and inauthentic being-in short, contra Western Orientalist universalism, the very injustices that China's modernity project has aimed to overcome and with which it risks assimilation.",82,"WOS:000414980500013",3

What initially began as an experiment to tweet a narrative in 140 characters became an intensely dynamic platform for engaging with the public and cultivating an authorial persona for the well- known author. By early 2015, Rushdie had nearly 700,000 Twitter followers and regularly appeared in news media for his Twitter content. Shortly after joining Twitter, Rushdie eagerly demonstrated his knowledge of the platform and has involved some of his 1.25 million followers in debates and conversations about a wide range of issues from the 2012 and 2016 presidential campaigns to gun control. More than just an interesting glimpse into Rushdie's everyday thoughts, his Twitter feed is a valuable archive. By applying qualitative discourse analysis to Rushdie's Twitter feed, patterns in Rushdie's use of the social network emerge, revealing some of the ways in which he attempts to engage readers, defend his positions, and cultivate his authorial legacy. This article develops careful categorization of concepts and themes which emerge from a review of Rushdie's tweets. Applying discourse analysis to this data will enable scholars to make valuable connections between analyses of Rushdie's published work and his social media persona.

Situating Gumbrecht's work within two contexts - its debt to a phenomenological heritage and its congruence with more recent literary criticism - the essay argues for a renewed emphasis on presence via the concept of mood or stimmung. It then seeks to extend Gumbrecht's work by offering an interpretation of William Faulkner's 1932 novel Light in August which concentrates upon the palpable presence (stimmung) of heat which it contains. The existence of this heat, it will be argued, depends upon elements of the text that initially appear meaningful - or, to utilise Gumbrecht's terminology, moments that are there primarily for their 'meaning effect' - but which analysis shows to be productive of presence. The essay concludes with a claim that what literary studies now requires is a re-ordering of the terms of emphasis in which discussions of meaning and presence are couched.",36,"WOS:000416544100009",3

One day, while riding an omnibus, Jennings sees two piercing deep red eyes staring at him, and gradually realises that they belong to a small black monkey, which was pushing its face forward in mimicry to meet mine (23). At first fancying the creature to be the ugly pet (23) of a fellow traveller, Jennings attempts to ascertain the monkey's mood, and poked my umbrella softly towards it. It remained immovable - up to it - through it! (23-24). Gradually, he becomes convinced of the creature's demonic nature, and this grinning, screeching vision persecutes Jennings for the rest of his days, sitting on his books and interrupting him while he studies, shrieking curses and blasphemies to drown out his prayers, soliciting him to perform evil acts, and finally, commanding him to commit suicide, which he does, slitting his own throat with a single-edged razor.

"English","dual signification; conflicting thematic meaning; complicated response; discovering methods; ""A Horseman in the Sky""",,"In some fictional narratives, literary significance resides in two parallel-trajectories of signification. They at once contradict and need each other in conveying the thematic message of the text. Going along only one of the two trajectories will result in a partial understanding not only of the thematic message but also of the character images and the aesthetic value of the narrative. The gradual perception of the two coexisting trajectories increasingly complicates the response to the verbal choices in the narrative. Such dual signification is essentially different from previously investigated complicated meanings of literary texts. This essay explores how the same verbal choices take on different degrees of importance and generate conflicting thematic meanings in the dual trajectory of signification in Ambrose Bierce's ""A Horseman in the Sky,"" which forms an implicit yet sharp contrast with the single trajectory in Bierce's ""The Affair at Coulter's Notch.""

This move is allegorized by the enshrining of the Erinyes (or Furies) in the Athenian Acropolis. This has been interpreted variously as a charter for political absolutism, a justification of the repression of matrilineal relationships, or as an expression of the often paradoxical manifestation of divinity in Greek tragedy. This article argues that deinon is an example of Aeschylus's use of a mythical mode of thought that rational discourse cannot easily access. To elaborate the meaning of Athena's deinon, I examine its shifting role in the Oresteia, alongside that of the Erinyes, and find modern analogues in the ideas of the sublime and the uncanny. In these concepts, post-Enlightenment reason theorizes paradoxes that were inherent properties of mythical reality to the archaic mind.

"English",,,"In The Defence of Poesy Sidney aligns learning from the exemplary images of fiction with falling in love. What may appear to be a lazy commonplace is more than that. Sidney's Neoplatonic understanding of love is bound up with his Neoplatonic theory of reading. In both models the object is the idea that lies behind appearances. A reader must apprehend the ""idea or fore-conceit"" of the poet in order not only to admire his fictional characters but to understand ""why and how"" the poet made them, and thus to move from this gnosis to imitative praxis. Similarly, a lover climbs the Platonic ladder of love, from the beauty of the beloved to an idea of beauty and ultimately to the divine maker of that idea. In the Platonic tradition loving, writing, and reading are never far apart, because they share so much common ground. With this background in mind, Sidney's representation of love in Astrophil and Stella and the Arcadia as a sort of readerly activity begins to look less casual. This article examines the sources and uses of Sidney's imagery of loving reading and writing which in the Arcadia cluster around Sidney's representations of Argalus and Parthenia, and of Pyrocles and Philoclea. It suggests that Sidney is not only using his models of idealizing reading to add color and depth to his depiction of love but is if we turn things round thinking in a more subtly worked-out manner than in the Defence about the mechanisms through which his readers will read; be delighted, learn, be moved, and ultimately find themselves transformed.",51,"WOS:000391903300002",3

The authors argue that it is this clash that sustains bidirectionality in a metaphor, by preserving the tension between its two subjects, while allowing each to alternatively become the focus of one's attention while reading. Donne's use of grotesque imagery thereby juxtaposes semantic fields and their worlds with frightening consequences, and this impacts upon the bidirectionality inherent in the process of metaphor comprehension. Furthermore, this essay will show how the poetic texts enable both embodied simulation and bodily feeling, both of which manifest embodied cognition in the reader; the authors therefore argue that Donne is, in fact, an early advocate of embodied cognition.",67,"WOS:000393270200008",3

The exploitative activities of Cosa Nostra in the tragic aftermath of the Second World War made clear to him Sicilian society's urgent need for progress towards greater social justice so that violence could be prevented. Fava developed an ethical conception of journalism and, by extension, of literature and theatre. Where there's truth', Fava wrote,' justice can be done and freedom can be defended'. This article shows how Giuseppe Fava put his intellectual impegno into practice in order to provide the Sicilian public with a means of interpreting and understanding the mechanisms behind the Sicilian tragedy, and an incentive to take up their collective responsibility. In order to illustrate how Fava translated his journalistic and intellectual impegno into cultural actions (Freire, 1998a) of an emancipatory character, it focuses on his use of the criminal trial as a metaphor for his journalistic investigation into the ills of Sicilian society in his essay Processo alla Sicilia (1967), and as a narrative framework for the closing chapters of his novels Prima che vi uccidano (1976) and Passione di Michele (1980) and for his courtroom dramas La Violenza (1969) and Ultima Violenza (1983). It shows how, by literally co-opting the audience as jurors in the trial - a technique which is in many respects reminiscent of the methodologies for conscientisation developed by Paulo Freire and Augusto Boal - Fava stimulated the Sicilian public to pursue their own freedom and dignity through the creative and continuous transformation of their contextual reality.",40,"WOS:000400158400003",3
"English",,,"In the late sixteenth century, the common law experienced a phenomenal growth, both in the number of practitioners and jurisdictional power. A comparison of popular and professional literature on legal administration or judicature reveals the complex and ambivalent cultural response to the ""rise"" of the common law. Despite the usual praise for the common law as that which distinguished England from France, Italy, and other countries using civil law, many questioned the law's ability to deliver justice. Popular writing on justice, produced by preachers, moral essayists, and dramatists, centered on the law's failure to protect the poor, weak, and otherwise marginalized members of society. While popular legal commentators lacked the power to reform legal practices, they attempted to shape the public's perception of the law and lawyers through the writing of legal character. Authors of assize sermons and character books defined the character of a ""good magistrate"" as a ""loving"" father. In contrast, legal writing by lawyers suppressed the language of love and placed the emphasis on reason. This article investigates the resulting friction between professional and popular representations of judges and judicature and examines its impact on Shakespearean drama. In Henry IV, Part 2, Shakespeare explores the dissonance and irresolution within the cultural discourse on legal administration, and in so doing, expresses a tragic truth about the paucity of justice in a world consumed by law.",82,"WOS:000391903300004",3

The future was not a bubble, untouched by time or trouble, but a field of battle, where ideas could be tested and philosophies given a test drive. The future was a place where the mistakes or triumphs of today dictated the course of human progress. I argue in this essay that the nascent ideas about euthanasia of the early and middle Victorian period became full-fledged philosophies in the late-Victorian period and that Malthusian philosophy and Darwinian-informed theories were manipulated by novelist and theorist-turned- novelists, resulting in euthanasia becoming a tool in class warfare and in the fight to eradicate social undesirables for their good and for the good of society.",44,"WOS:000395430200006",3

The violence and schism had become so severe that King Henri IV had converted to Catholicism in attempt to pacify his nation. Nothing about Frances situation would seem to lend itself to a romantic comedy for a Protestant England. If, however, we examine Loves Labours Lost alongside the representations of Henri, the Catholic League, and Frances situation that were coming out of the English presses between 1593 and 1595, a different picture emerges. The gap between history and Shakespeares play dramatically narrows, and the play becomes funnier. The comedy remains critical and wary of Henri, but allows English spectators to laugh with, rather than at, a weak but unified France. Shakespeares clever reworkings of topical connections create a political spoof humorous to the large numbers of Londoners reading the news. Through the redemptive impulses of comedy, Shakespeare creates a space for tolerating Henri as a Catholic working to stabilize his nationas long as this French King stays under Englands and Elizabeths auspices.

To reflect on this link, it investigates the Calvinist rhetoric of preterition (nonelection to salvation) and its influence on contemporary US culture through Pynchon's work. First, it studies Calvin's concept of preterition and how it becomes connected to the wasted (disregarded, passed over, or used up); and second, based on Calvin's conception of preterition, it goes on to explore how the proliferation of waste in the contemporary America portrayed by Pynchon is the outcome of the capitalist economic system and its reliance on technology that converges with secularization and modernity.",20,"WOS:000432024900009",3

What would a husband do with his wife's hair brushes? What claim could he have to her workbasket? Though the common law of coverture gave nearly all legal rights of ownership to husbands, leaving married women a mere smattering of ambiguous claims to pin money and paraphernalia, married women were nonetheless encouraged to cultivate ownership of objects through access, proximity, use, and emotional connection. Such unofficial ownership of household objects did not pose a threat to men's legal ownership or economic power, but was instead a necessary component of marriage since it allowed women to participate properly - according to domestic ideology - in the union of one flesh. Historians and literary critics of the last twenty-five years have explored the power Victorian middle-class women gain from their gendered relationship to the domestic space.

The analysis reveals that constituents are mainly likely to be fronted when the information they represent is given (regardless of variety).

"English",,,"In the section devoted to Attention in The Principles of Psychology (1890), William James describes how the adaptation of the attention' can alter our perception of an image so as to permit multiple visual formulations (417). In his example of a two-dimensional drawing of a cube, we can see the three-dimensional body only once our attention has been primed by preperception: the image formed by the combination of lines has no connection with what the picture ostensibly represents (419, 418). In a footnote to this passage, however, James uses an example from Hermann Lotze's Medicinische Psychologie (1852), to show how a related phenomenon can occur involuntarily, and in states of distraction rather than attention: In quietly lying and contemplating a wall-paper pattern, sometimes it is the ground, sometimes the design, which is clearer and consequently comes nearer...all without any intention on our part....Often it happens in reverie that when we stare at a picture, suddenly some of its features will be lit up with especial clearness, although neither its optical character nor its meaning discloses any motive for such an arousal of the attention. (419) James uses the formal illogicality of the wallpaper (its lack of compositional center prevents it from dictating the trajectory for our attention according to intrinsic aesthetic laws) to demonstrate the volatility of our ideational centers, particularly in moments of reverie or inattention. Without the intervention of the will, James says, our cognitive faculties are always in undirected motion, which occurs below the strata of our mental apprehension. Momentary instances of focus or attunement are generated only by the imperceptible and purely random irradiations of brain-tracts (420). Attention, for James, is the artistic power of the mind; it applies emphasis, intelligible perspective, and clear and vivid form to the objects apprehended by the faculties of perception, it makes experience more than it is made by it (381). Reverie, a moment when attention has been reduced to a minimum, thus demands an alternative aesthetic analog, where composition is reduced to a minimum too.",74,"WOS:000400962200001",3

Both in the pursuit of the theatrical reforms that were advocated by Bulwer as a Whig member of parliament and in his new venture into dramatic writing, the author relied heavily on French models. The article analyses the French influence in Bulwer's first dramas that composed his cycle of French history plays, The Duchess de la Valliere (1837), The Lady of Lyons, or Love and Pride (1838) and Richelieu, or The Conspiracy (1839). Beyond using French sources and setting the action of these plays in France, the inspiration from French culture and history crucially imbued Bulwer with a sense of freedom to essay his peculiar and intuitive conflation of politics and romance. This freedom is especially the case in Bulwer's first works, for which after the revolutionary experience, a French context became the most suitable framework to articulate liberal ideas, to reflect the creation of a modern consciousness that was represented by the rise of the people and to connect these interests with the theatrical portrayal of manners, passion and sentiment.",33,"WOS:000422974900003",3

Tolkien, writing in a period before concepts such as ecology or ecocriticism entered social and academic vocabulary, expresses a stance that champions responsible stewardship as key to a fruitful mode of being in the world. The present article centres specifically on how Tolkien's portrayal of trees act as a mythical presence that combines and enhances natural and spiritual elements to define an interaction between human(oid) beings and nature which is not only contingent on the particular needs of Elves and Men, but also premised upon the preservation of the beauty and wonder of the natural world. Symbolically, the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor sets a mythical precedent and transfers stewardship of Arda from the divine Valar to the Children of Iluvatar (Elves and Men). I shall argue that the tenets of this stewardship, derived from a combination of spirit and matter connected to the Two Trees, are at the very core of the moral struggle in Middle-earth, because as dwellers in this world, the relationship of Men and Elves with creation - made up of matter and spirit both - will determine their fate. As The Silmarillion prefigures many of Tolkien's later literary works, the expression of stewardship in this work is important for our understanding not only of the moral disposition of Elves and Men, and of the stories of their misfortunes and triumphs that occupy the central stage in Tolkien's legendarium, but also of the role of trees in Tolkien's entire ouvre.",24,"WOS:000425102700002",3

William Shakespeare's narrative poem Venus and Adonis (1593) is deeply influenced by the basium. By employing and subverting the main motifs of kiss poetry, Shakespeare positions himself in between two poetic traditions: one that is plaintive, chaste, and normally associated with Petrarch and his legacy, and one that is more sensual and uninhibitedly corporeal, made popular in the sixteenth century by Neo-Latin and French poets.

"English",,,"In the study of comparative literature today, World Literature has come to function as a subdiscipline that probes the circulation of literary texts, seeking to overcome or minimize cultural hierarchies. While proponents of World Literature view translation as the ultimate vehicle for achieving these goals, critics emphasize the limits of translation and the need to acknowledge cultural asymmetries rather than assume they might be abolished. In the work of the Hebrew writer Y. H. Brenner (1881-1921), one finds similar discussions around translation and linguistic and cultural hierarchies. Brenner's 1907 play Beyond the Borders (Me'ever lagvulin) tackles explicitly the issue of literary marginality, anticipating contemporary discussions around World Literature. Brenner's 1908 review-essay ""From the World of Our Literature"" (Me'olam sifruteinu) complements the play, grappling with the question of what makes a literary work worthy of translation. In both works, Brenner refers to the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen as a problematic example of global or European literary fame. In discussing Ibsen, Brenner converses implicitly with the Danish literary critic Georg Brandes, whose work and success drew the attention of Hebrew intellectuals at the beginning of the twentieth century.

The discussion draws on Silvia Federici's work on women, the body and primitive accumulation and on Jason Moore's theory of negative-value in the capitalist world-ecology, to account for why, in Vera's work, the female body is invariably positioned, abjectly, at the nexus of colonial governance and what David Moore has described as Zimbabwe's postcolonial regime of violent accumulation.",36,"WOS:000408919300008",3

However, the same ambiguity that makes Eberhardt's legend so engaging also generates an image that is as much a figure of paternal law as one that challenges gender norms for women in the space of a ""new"" France in colonial Algeria. This article unravels the complex heritage of travel imagery that informed the work of French women travel writers such as Henriette Celarie, paying attention to the ways in which Celarie incorporates Eberhardt's legend as a new element that both deconstructs and bolsters the traditional views of gender and culture circulating in women's travel writing of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

But rather, it seems crucial that inter-ethnic studies should be included in the discipline of Chinese comparative literature, considering the fact that there are 55 officially recognized and registered Chinese minorities, constituting nearly 8.5% (113 million) of the total population of China, each with their own distinct and rich cultural heritage and literary tradition.",23,"WOS:000397397700003",3
"English",,,"In their article ""Zamyatin's Reception of Well's Fiction,""Natalia Aksenova and Marina Albertovna Khatyamova examine several essays written by Yevgeny Zamyatin on Herbert Wells's texts and analyse Zamyatin's reception of Wells's work. Wells's ironic mindset, plot-driven writings, and attraction to parody drew Zamyatin's attention. Zamyatin felt a rapport with the central role of plot dynamics, unorthodox socialist politics, and dystopian tendencies in Wells's fiction. Discussions of the artistic qualities of Wells's writings allow Zamyatin to expound upon his own aesthetic program, known as ""synthetism."" In these discussions Zamyatin interprets Wells's work as a complex interpretation of technological modernity where the line between humans and gods is actively blurred, and traces the origins of Wellsian fiction to his predecessors, mostly English-language adventure writers. In doing so, Zamyatin gives Wells credit for extending the typical adventure novel into a philosophical realm while keeping it entertaining and captivating. Furthermore, in terms of the reimagining of the Apollonian and Dionisyan opposition as an opposition between English and Irish in Zamyatin's ""English stories"" of the same period, Wells is read as a typical Englishman: an unorthodox heretic. Ultimately, it becomes clear that these are the qualities that Zamyatin values most in Wells.",10,"WOS:000397397700008",3

The authors explore the way the TRC disregarded Mrs Konile's testimony about her son's murder because they did not see it as a clear and straightforward narrative of victimhood. In the process of trying to understand Mrs Konile's testimony and life, all three authors as racialized persons living in South Africa are confronted with various aspects of shame. The article uses excerpts from There Was This Goat to explore Australia-based writer Elspeth Probyn's conception of shame as a productive force that has the power to radically transform notions of the self and the political arena. Comparing Probyn's account in Blush: Faces of Shame and other texts of her visit to Uluru in Australia's Northern Territory with the trip to Indwe in the Eastern Cape made by the authors of There Was This Goat, it discusses how shame can be embedded in space. It critiques Probyn's argument that shame can be transformative of power dynamics by looking at Krog's feelings of displacement as a white South African. Probyn's construction of shame may challenge social inequalities, but it is also a privileged and elusive shame that can reproduce colonial structures and relationships.",27,"WOS:000417631400005",3

In this article the question is posed, whether their insights may be transposed to the broader field of language, specifically in the sense of discourse, to help one under-stand the possibility of a ""minor discourse"" - a particular way of using discourse - that would be ""directly political"", as opposed to the dominant discourses of the present, which tend to disguise their political effectivity behind an economic facade. Moreover, what are the chances that such a minor discourse could deterritorialise the existing, dominant discourse of neoliberalism to the point where fissures may appear within which a ""minor discourse"" might be strengthened?

Coetzee, Waiting for the Barbarians (1980), in an attempt to show how it stages an insufficiency of the ethical reaction, by positioning it upon a social stage which determines its reach and effects. I proceed by reading this stage in the categories of Giorgio Agamben's concept of the state of emergency, which spans throughout all of the novel""s events, and defines the relations between its main characters, the Magistrate (novel's narrator and protagonist), the ""barbarian girl,"" and Colonel Joll. My main focus rests on two episodes: firstly, I present how the Magistrates supposed humane treatment of the ""barbarian girl"" is in fact only a humanization of the imperial domination, and secondly I analyze the scene of mass torture of the ""barbarians,"" led by Colonel Joll, in which the Magistrate's reaction is shown to be misplaced and insufficient. Finally, by reverting to Badiou's understanding of ethics, I show that both the Magistrate and Colonel Joll function within the boundaries of the imperial logic, and how the Magistrate's ethical reactions remain ineffective precisely because they do not question the very foundations, the supposed universal law, from which they stem, and therefore never manage to reach the objective level of action. In this sense Coetzee's novel, on the level of form, fulfills that which is presented as lacking on the level of its content - by making its readers find a position outside of the logic of its characters, it presents them with the insufficiency of ethics devoid of any relation to politics.",12,"WOS:000405143000010",3

This article focuses on their essays written during the 1960s, as they became the last representatives of world literature in the Israeli-Hebrew literary republic. Their work as unique writers and as members of their literary generation represented a critical moment in the history of Hebrew modern literature, a moment of renegotiation of the boundaries of national literature in a multilingual world. Goldberg's and Grodzensky's essayistic prose showed a new and empathic relation of the Hebrew text toward foreign words. Furthermore, a central claim in this article is that these writers' self-estranged mode of mediation modestly posed a question mark over the very notion of a Jewish national unified native language.",39,"WOS:000419357700002",3

I begin with a brief examination of the most prominent characteristics that define childhood in North America, the primary target market for these works. I draw on these concepts in my analysis of how the characters mature in their respective texts. The genre presents an alternative (though not preferable) model for childhood development: chronological age is diminished by military rank, the binary opposition between soldiers and civilians replaces graduated social distinctions between adults and children, and war disrupts the ostensibly natural developmental processes. Moreover, the genre suggests that rehabilitation is only possible through relocation to the West. I conclude that although the genre does offer portrayals of more normative childhoods in Africa, these alternative examples are obscured by the sensational depiction of the lost childhoods of child soldier characters.",54,"WOS:000435327800004",3
"English","The Cookbook Collector; Text; Terrain; Temporality; Archive","JEWISH","In this article I explore Allegra Goodman's 2010 novel The Cookbook Collector, which has received no critical attention. In part the novel is extremely timely in that it signals our contemporary concern with materiality, in which digitalization seems to portend the erasure of print culture and at the same time cause a reactive and romantic embrace of tangible physical texts. At another level, the novel also attempts to re-address the position and role of Judaism during the dotcom boom and bust era of 1999-2002. I argue that while compared to Goodman's earlier works this novel appears to situate Judaism peripherally, it in fact endorses what I term a strong Jewish ""sensibility"" because of its focus on texts (letters and cookbooks in particular, Torah as a more implicit backdrop). I examine the presentation of texts as archives (as sites of memory and also as anticipatory absences), texts as both utterances and material objects, the relationship between texts and terrain (the natural landscape), and texts and temporality, noting the way that Judaism seems to offer, in the novel, a reconciliation of memory (physical text versus uttered text), and identity (collective versus individualistic).",50,"WOS:000422951800003",3
"English","script development; creative process; screenwriter; imagination; screen idea; methodology",,"In this article I foreground screenwriting as a creative writing practice, and argue that there are significant aspects of the genesis of screenplays that are not sufficiently acknowledged in the development field. In that field it is common practice that screen-writers produce formatted prose documents, predicting their screen stories in detail before the writing of a first draft is initiated. A pre-formatted approach - defined here as the Set Stage Chronology of Documents (SSCD) - has been institutionalized in European and American script culture, manifesting itself in schools, funding institutions and contract formulas. This practice implies that one specific writing method is universal and de-emphasizes such aspects of creativity as improvisation, free association and the accessing of subconscious resources - all widely assumed to be significant in creative work. Drawing upon a case study - the writing of my screenplay September during a fellowship at the Norwegian Film School - I ask how principles of improvisation can be adapted and applied to the writing of the first draft screenplay. Informed by the Russian stage director Konstantin Stanislavsky's model for improvisation in theatre rehearsals, and the associative method practiced by screenwriter J. C. Carriere in his workshops, I suggest specific tools for 'structured improvisation' as used in the writing of September.",39,"WOS:000418325900004",3

"English","Atonement; intersubjectivity; (mis)understanding; cognitive science","MIND; SIMULATION; EMPATHY","In this article I will explore the ways in which Ian McEwan's novel Atonement (2001) engages with contemporary scientific and philosophical theories of intersubjectivity. Recent cognitive and philosophical approaches to intersubjectivity deem as reductive an understanding of social interactions solely in terms of theory of mind, i.e., as inferential and observational processes, and provide instead a multilayered account of intersubjectivity incorporating the embodied and affective coupling between self and others (primary intersubjectivity), the capacity to participate in cooperative projects (secondary intersubjectivity), and narrative competences/practices. Through a close reading of how McEwan stages and reflects on the complex interplay between understanding and misunderstanding lying at the heart of social interaction, I will argue that Atonement can be read as a critique of complex forms of social interaction (including storytelling), advocating instead a reliance on embodied, affective, and collaborative forms of intersubjectivity.",80,"WOS:000414066800012",3
"English","legitimacy; Goths; Spain; ethnic myth",,"In this article I will show the importance of symbolic links to history as a means of legitimacy, and that this legitimacy does not need to be true but to be considered true, at least by the people who claim this legitimacy, and that it can be reused if needed. When the western part of the Roman Empire finally broke up in the fourth and fifth centuries, the Goths had been allowed into the Roman Empire as foederatii. They came from regions close to the Black Sea, where they united into two major groups the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths. Both these groups turned westwards and were sometimes allied with the Empire and sometimes they opposed it. The origin of the Goths is controversial as they had come from somewhere in the north; according to legend, they had links with Scandinavia, but this question will not be discussed here. On their long and laborious journey westwards, the Visigoths ended up in what was to become Spain in the mid-sixth century. Due to internal conflicts among the royalty and noble families, the Moors (Muslim Arabs and Berbers from Morocco; see below) were invited to help one of the sides in this conflict. They came, they won and they stayed, which was never the intention of the princes who had invited them originally. However, after the Moorish conquest of Spain in 711 what little Visigothic/Spanish resistance remained was confined to the Cantabrian mountains and the victorious Moors talked with disdain about the Visigothic leader Don Pelayo and his 30 'donkeys' (= men) in Cantabria in the north. In Pelayo's and his successors' need for legitimacy as the (re)conquest went on, the Gothic heritage played a very important role for many centuries, and the Scandinavian origin was also taken as an argument to prove the truly ancient lineage of the Goths, which reinforced their claims for legitimacy as the true and rightful kings of Castile. Thus this heritage is central to the ethnic myth of the population, and, especially, of the royal family. The ethnic myth in itself is the mirror image of a people's supposed origin and history and how the people today sees itself in the light of a partly-imagined history, or at least of a subjective interpretation of this history.",30,"WOS:000402672900005",3

The thought experiment is a device common to science and philosophy and has been recognised as an heuristic tool in literature generally, but here children's literature is drawn into the conversation, revealing that-as a dynamic mechanism of children's narrative-thought experiments have a long-standing and particular role to play in books for young people. This paper connects with a recent turn in children's literature discourse toward the conditions of power in books for young readers; it moves on the debate by demonstrating that the apparatus of thought experimentation places the implied child reader in a position of philosophical responsibility and forward thinking. Presenting thought experiments in different ways, formal properties of the thought experiment-such as conversational mode, double engagement and modal positioning-are identified and shown to open up a philosophical space of subsequence in children's texts.",32,"WOS:000401423100004",3

However, we also find that such expressions of judgment are marshalled in interview settings by a strong moral imperative to appear open, tolerant and respectful of others. We argue that these apparently contradictory accounts represent the collision of interviewees' spontaneous visceral and scripted honourable selves. We also focus on how this complex presentation of self plays out in social life- both in terms of respondents' interactions with ourselves, as interviewers, and in their recollections of everyday-life encounters with those very different to themselves. Strikingly aware that others may perceive them as 'snobbish' and 'elitist', interviewees go to lengths to downplay difference in social encounters. Such reflexive monitoring of self-presentation, we argue, constitutes a distinct Bourdieusian 'strategy of condescension', allowing the privileged to both benefit publically from adherence to culturally dominant norms of openness, while continuing to privately harbour private feelings of snobbery. Thus, contrary to claims that the pervasiveness of egalitarian moral sentiments makes cultural-aesthetical boundaries less effective in social life, we argue that flying under the moral radar of egalitarian sentiments may intentionally or otherwise- help secure the legitimacy of cultural distinctions.

The project focuses on three contexts in which children and adults interact with books: the home, the school and the book market. Theoretical inspirations have been drawn from book history, children's literature studies and childhood studies, including the concept of agency. A major database maps Danish books aimed at children 1750-1850, making it possible to trace the popularity of titles through reprints and new editions and to follow specific actors (authors, illustrators, printers and so on). Ego-documents by children - for example, letters written by Ida Thiele (1830-1862) - are analysed as sources of information on children's own experiences with books, their use of different media and their interaction with peers, relatives and teachers in relation to reading and books. Finally, we demonstrate how significant changes in form, content and the materiality of books for children can be captured, when following specific books such as E.

"English",,,"In this article, I argue that the strident response of Nigerian writers, in the form of belligerent discourse of resistance, to the systematic destruction of the environment and its inhabitants in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria could be taken as literary militancy. This literary militancy is provoked by what one may see as the tripartite system of ruination, having three agents of destruction, namely the multinational oil corporations, the federal soldiers, and the local militias who call themselves militants. Because of their huge appetite for petrodollars, the oil companies cause the existence of local militias and federal soldiers, set against each other to fight while the companies continue to release toxins into air, lands, and waters. In the end, the local communities suffer and die from not only physical violence, as the soldiers and militias unleash terror on them, but from nonphysical, attritional violence that, many scholars of environmentalism agree, is worse. Literary militancy emerges as a discourse force to confront this system of ruination, condemning the aforementioned agents of destruction.

"English",,,"In this article, I explore representations of King Arthur's reign in a group of genealogical chronicles and rolls written in Anglo-Norman prose which flourished in England in the last quarter of the thirteenth century and early decades of the fourteenth. These short histories began as accounts of Anglo-Saxon and later English kings, but many copies soon acquired a prologue recounting the history of selected mythical British rulers ultimately derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia regum Britanniae. Shockingly in the face of Galfridian tradition, this prologue omits King Arthur. However, close examination of individual manuscripts reveals that scribes nevertheless made space for Arthur in the compressed historical narrative. I analyse the different approaches these scribes took to fitting Arthur into the genealogical text, and consider the implications of Arthur's inclusion for the shaping of English history and (imagined) royal lineage. I argue that these texts present Arthur as 'English', as the eminent ruler of Engletere and ancestor of contemporary English kings, through an imagined and geographical lineage that unites rulers of different ethnicities. King Arthur is found in these royal genealogies long before he appears in those produced in fifteenth-century England, which have benefitted from more scholarly attention. My study sheds light on the development of royal genealogical rolls in England, in terms of their increasing inclusion of Galfridian kings.

"English",,,"In this article, I read Balzac's La Peau de chagrin as a novel of feeling, in which Raphael's act of telling his life story entails a sensory encounter with the narrative self. Beginning with the novel's emblematic epigraph, then following through a series of significant encounters within it, I show that Raphael, by putting his life into narrative, is forced to come upon himself as narrative object. Examining these encounters first through the vector of physiognomy, then through twentieth-century theories of play, and always paying particular attention to the visual aspects of touch and feeling, I read them as moments of ""corporeal mimesis"" which cast Raphael in a thing- or object-like state. This spectacle of mimesis, in which subject is cast as object, is aptly figured by the magical piece of skin at the novel's centre, the organ of touch, shrinking at the expression of desire and thus functioning as a visual measure for the compromised narrative life.",25,"WOS:000400951200005",3

Reading a range of media texts, I trace a pattern of representation that I identify as contained within a recognizable genre of the moral narrative and use this genre to identify a structure of narrative of issues around gender and sexuality in Kenya. The examples are drawn from a popular radio drama program as well as from popular press reports of wayward women. The article also engages counter-narratives created by women such Vera Sidika and Huddah Monroe who, by publicly displaying their near-naked bodies in public platforms, create room for a counter-reading of discourses of gender and sexuality in the Kenyan public imaginary.

Starting from the premise that the power in the belly in Nyatsumba's story lies precisely in the fact that the narrative is told from the perspective of the abandoned wife, the author employs Ross Chambers' ""renewed narratology"" of studying ""narrative situations in stories"" to determine how Nyatsumba's narrative makes its ""point"" by using seductive narrative manoeuvres to win the ideological assent of its readers.

"English","Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; Animal studies; Ecocriticism; Medieval literature",,"In this ecocritical and animal studies reading of the anonymous fourteenth-century poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (ca. 1375-1400), I focus on what the poem divulges about medieval attitudes toward hunting animals for sport. Studies that focus on the blurring of conceptual, cognitive, and ethical distinctions between animals and humans in medieval literature invite consideration of that blurring as it is found in the triple hunt scenes of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. My argument is that the triple hunt scenes confront the problem of truth (trawA 3/4e) in the context of animal sports as well as in the context of the games in which Bertilak invites Gawain and the court of Camelot to participate. In elaborating on the given content, I also note the thematic and conceptual overlaps among Bertilak, Gawain, and the fox, a tripling that scholars have overlooked in their focus on the parallels between Gawain and the deer, boar, and fox. I rely on scholarly studies by such key figures in animal studies and medieval studies as Jeffrey Jerome Cohen and Susan Crane and such key figures in ecocriticism and medieval studies as Gillian Rudd and Corinne J. Saunders in my focus on animal hunting in medieval Britain. In addition, I refer to several modern translations of the poem: two recent translations by W. S.

"English","Sylvia Plath; The Bell Jar; inoperative community; singularity; finitude; exposure","'BELL-JAR'; PLATH,SYLVIA","In this essay I intend to offer an analysis of Sylvia Plath's novel The Bell Jar (1963) that goes beyond the scope of the confessional and feminist readings which have prevailed in Plathian studies. Following the critical interest raised by the notion of community and its problematic relationship with individual subjectivity in recent decades, I draw on Jean-Luc Nancy's understanding of ""community"" (1985-1986) in order to offer an alternative interpretation of The Bell Jar. The theoretical framework which inspires this essay declares the impossibility of an operative community which actually fulfils the natural longing of all human beings for immanence and transcendence. I argue that The Bell Jar actually tackles the interruption of two long-standing myths-the possibility of community and the assertion of autonomy of the self. Since the latter has already been addressed by several authors as a central issue in Plath's novel, I here focus on how she deals with the shattered myth of community. Far from being a narcissistic account of private traumas, the novel is paradoxically an attempt to share with others a universal plight-the overwhelming sense of humans as exposed and finite beings facing the absence of a community of immanence. Ironically, it is the sharing of that disturbing truth which allows the emergence of community in Plath's novel.",26,"WOS:000404460200004",3
"English",,,"In this essay I reassess the role and position of English in the current context of global cultural exchanges from the vantage point of Anglophone diasporas. Whilst postcolonial studies have given much thought to the status and role of the English language as an instrument of cultural domination, much remains to be said about the role of English in a diasporic context, not only as an instrument of self-reinvention but also as that which both acts upon speakers and is acted upon through their linguistic interventions. This question-a key one in studies of Anglophone diasporas-is positioned in relation to the complex binary that opposes standard English to its modern-day avatars, and in particular the standardised English of corporate culture, which itself differs from the ""new Englishes."" I look specifically at the way Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's novel Americanah (2013) presents the position of diasporic subjects and their practice of code-switching as offering a metaperspective on the power-relations of the Anglophone sphere today, before offering some thoughts on the necessity of new linguistic genealogies in the twenty-first century.",36,"WOS:000415826900007",3

"English",,,"In this essay, Gano argues that while Michelle Tea's Valencia records and celebrates the particular, oppositional social practices of the Mission's queer community as its members successfully create and claim space in the city, it also presents the reader with a Mission conspicuously cleansed of the racialized struggles of Latinos and people of color more broadly who were, in this very time and place, being pushed out of the neighborhood. Gano situates this novel within two primary, entwined generic contexts: the urban frontier narrative and the ""American neoconfessional"" memoir. Gano first shows that the novel engages with a kind of frontier nostalgia, most powerfully expressed by Frederick Jackson Turner and commonly deployed in the rhetorics surrounding late twentieth-century gentrification. This particular form of nostalgia simultaneously romanticizes and mourns the passing of a wild and wooly space of opportunity and personal freedom; in Valencia, this is the transitional space of San Francisco's Mission district in the early 1990s. Michelle, the book's protagonist, heroically navigates the mean streets of the Mission in her search for love; as is typical of what Leigh Gilmore has called the neoconfessional memoir, Valencia emphasizes the protagonist's success in overcoming personal hardship while minimizing a broader historical and social contextualization of individual struggle. After all, there are winners and losers on the urban frontier: this nostalgic look back at the exhilarating San Francisco punk dyke scene depends particularly on the overt occlusion of the racial dimensions of gentrification. Drawing on the work of cultural geographer Neil Smith, Gano argues that the whitewashing of the urban frontier in Valencia is not only central to its generic success but is an important element that helps to enable a heroic narrative of gentrification process more broadly.",46,"WOS:000409160000005",3

In her memoir Farm City: The Education of an Urban Farmer (2009), Carpenter's story of small family farming, indeed, evokes what Eric T. Freyfogle describes as an agrarian mode of life in which humans, as members of the land community, are ""just as dependent as other life on the land's fertility and just as shaped by its mysteries and possibilities"" (Freyfogle, in: Freyfogle (ed) The new agrarianism: land, culture, and the community of life, Island Press, Washington, DC, 2001, p. xiii). Carpenter's return to the city, however, marks a critical break from traditional understandings of agrarianism, challenging the city-country binary that has long been employed in the imagining of agrarianism. Farming in the city, like traditional agrarians she is attentive to the agencies of nonhuman entities and matters; unlike them, she moves beyond their rurality to reconfigure cities as agential bodies constantly in dynamic processes of becoming. In Farm City, her return from the land shifts the emphasis from the countryside to the city, evoking a ""new agrarianism"" that foregrounds both environmental stewardship and community-citizenship. The urban strain of Carpenter's farming experience, I argue, not only brings to the fore the agronomic and spiritual potentialities of inner cities but forges a new ethical relation embracing humanity and history as active agents of the agrarian community.",20,"WOS:000414980500010",3
"English","affect; narrative; worldmaking; referentiality; nonsovereign narration; (post-)critique","OF-OSCAR-WAO; 10 THESES; FICTIONALITY","In this essay, I propose a new model and methodology for investigating the productive, layered ways in which affects operate in and through narrative texts in the communicative loops of reading and writing. I delineate this model by way of a dialogue between different concepts of worlding, world-building, and worldmaking circulating in narrative and affect theory, which provide connecting points between the two fields as well as diverging (Deleuzian, neuroscientific, phenomenological) approaches to affect. In developing these connecting points, the proposed syncretic model addresses the shortcomings of current uses of affect, including the foreclosure of textuality and subjectivity in Deleuzian conceptualizations and the narrow emotion concepts and generalizing tendencies of neuroscientific approaches. In reconceptualizing narrative worldmaking as a multidimensional, `multivectorar assemblage of heterogeneous elements, I detail how the rhetorical processes of narration and reading engage affects, bodily memories, and associations in layered transactions between characters, narrators, implied and actual readers and authors. Probing the model's productivity through a reading of Junot Diaz's The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, I spell out three sets of implications for narrative theory: I consider fictionality's affective engagement in the world, the workings of distributed, nonsovereign agency in the loop of literary communication, and the potentials of reconfigurative reading as a methodology of 'following' affective complexity.",77,"WOS:000400224000005",3

"English",,,"In this essay, I suggest a new methodology for the analysis of literary texts in Afrophone languages.

Supported by corpus-related data, my analysis will show that Chakaipa's narrator speaks with a public voice that has a certain moral in mind and displays a patriarchal outlook. In Mungoshi's novel we find a splitting of the narrative into different voices as well as an understated tone focusing on private rather than on public matters.

At the same time, I also invite one to see how Italy was the material text in which the Anthropocene was being inscribed.

Far from appearing as mere background incidentals, the poet's treatment of the seabirds we first encounter resonates with contemporary ornithological knowledge, and suggests that they feature specifically as species that best convey the ascetic trials and endeavours of the sea-going speaker who observes, listens to and names seabirds. The curious essence of seabirds as creatures that are always at home on the seas, and yet journeying to a home elsewhere, establishes them as what I term ""native foreigners"", a paradox that highlights the seafarer's conflicting yearnings and reflects the difficult earthly/celestial dynamic in the poem's perceptions of the soul's journey.",65,"WOS:000422841500004",3

Vidal's own language provides a vocabulary for other scholars including Henri Bergson and Gilles Deleuze, who saw cinema and geography in similar terms. By reading images of France as dynamic rather than static, Vidal provides a mobile composite of information pulled from a host of images that together generate a meaningful narrative of French identity.

Through the didactic function of mothers, Vlasopolos demonstrates that motherhood ensures Jewish women's psychological and genealogical endurance in the face of Fascist and Communist anti-Semitism. The memoir also indicates that Jewish women's personal motivation to become mothers stems from their needs to maintain a distinctive political and historical identity and to foster an awareness of a legacy that Fascism and Communism in Romania ignored altogether. In No Return Address, the maternal implicates the memoirist in two ways. First, Vlasopolos is a daughter, engaging in meaningful relationships with her mother and other ""mother"" figures who survived the Holocaust and Romanian Fascism (1923-1943).

Moreover, we would not want corporations to disappear given their positive impact in some contexts. Corporations hold the potential for an environmental ethics in their ""corporate personhood"" status, which I read through Haraway's cyborg theory to argue that the corporation always already exists as cyborgian in its interaction with human and nonhuman material bodies. In (re)inventing the cyborg corporation, I extrapolate the potential for an environmental ethics in corporate personhood from the utopian trend in science fiction's representation of multinational corporations, beginning with Edward Bellamy's industrial army in Looking Backward (1887) and culminating in Bacigalupi's agribusinesses in The Windup Girl (2009) and Winterson's MORE in The Stone Gods (2009). Although Bellamy fails to address environmental impact, and Bacigalupi and Winterson find the corporation responsible for environmental degradation, I suggest that Haraway's socialist-feminist cyborg provides an alternative theoretical framework for re(en)visioning the corporation as a socialist entity akin to David Schweickart's proposal in After Capitalism or its pragmatic counterpart, the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation.",38,"WOS:000394556100002",3

But Juliet's bicycle seems to create a balance between the two worlds. The bicycle as the never-failing steel horse enables her to utilize the achievements of industrial mechanization and also allows for a degree of freedom and human agency.

The theatrical field is formalized as an affiliation network of companies participating in stage co-productions in Italy's Campania region, over four theatre seasons. Differently from Bourdieu, but similarly to other works in the sociology of culture and the arts, the study focuses on relational and attribute-based dimensions of theatre production, presenting a novel way to combine field theory and SNA. By adopting the positional approach of SNA through Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and blockmodeling for affiliation networks, the study reveals oppositions among companies by reason of their differential partnerships in co-productions, and a combination of hierarchy and segmentation characterizing the network structure of the field. These oppositions also appear in the 'objective' social space defined by the attributes of companies and co productions (positions and position-takings), showing the unequal distribution of symbolic cultural capital among theatre producers and the latter's inclinations towards different theatrical styles and genres.

As with many post-colonial countries, Indonesia has suffered from a long conflict between the military forces and civil society since its independence in 1945. This struggle is reflected in a novel entitled The Dancer written by Ahmad Tohari during the Suharto era and its film adaptation with the same title by Ifa Isfansyah in the post-Suharto era. Using the political theory of depoliticisation, I argue that the adaptation represents the spirit of repoliticisation of the early post-Soeharto Indonesia while concurrently offering a distinctive type of depoliticisation typical of the current era. Not only does the study try to shift attention from Anglo-American and Commonwealth film adaptations, but it also offers an alternative to the homogenising discourse of the Centre (the West) and Periphery (the East) and its derivative post-colonial adaptation theories.",43,"WOS:000397958600002",3

"English",,,"Inscribed in a general theory of rhyme, the present article deals with the question of the relation between rhyme and intertextuality. As a premise, I briefly anticipate the main assumptions of my theory, with particular regard to what I have called the figural function of rhyme. Then, the close link between rhyme and memory is investigated, in light of both the coeval art of memory and modern psychology studies. Its mnemotechnical power is also the basis of its intertextual potential, in a shift from what is simply memorizable to what is memorable obtained through aestheic enhancement, mainly due to the so-called figural function. A brief comparison with Homeric formularity shows how verse-making devices may influence the text far beyond the mere scope of metrics, involving in particular literary memory phenomena. Finally, a selection of examples are provided to give an account of the many and varied types of intertextual relations the borrowing of rhymes may carry. It is a well-known fact that rhymes, when borrowed from previous texts, may become a privileged vehicle of intertextual allusion or reminiscence. Nonetheless, in the infrequent studies on rhyme, this issue has only recently begun to be addressed in a specific way and with not completely satisfactory results. What in particular is still lacking is a general theoretical framework concerning rhyme, with which we may connect the question of its intertextual potential. Indeed, this device has been much less studied than would be expected considering its historical relevance. Moreover a general theory regarding rhyme, going beyond the traditional typological distinctions proposed by metrical treatises, is still to be completed.",46,"WOS:000412618000001",3

J. Naud's The Alphabet of Birds (2014) and Stacy Hardy's Because the Night (2015). Masande Ntshanga radically reconsiders the risk of HIV infection and its relationship to intimacy. In Achmat Dangor's short stories, the refuge originally offered by exile is transferred to the transient refuge provided by the bodies of others. Makhosazana Xaba and S. J. Naude consider same-sex intimacy. Stacy Hardy's short stories explore sex, longing and alienation. Both Hardy and Xaba in different ways celebrate female sexuality. In reading these works, I investigate whether there is an 'ethics of risk1' at work. Risk is not tied to crime, violence, sexually transmitted diseases - although these are all present. Rather risk occurs in the sphere of relationships, of encounters with others, where intimacy itself is a somatic risk which potentially threatens the identity of the protagonists but also offers refuge.",36,"WOS:000396780800007",3

In the particular case of Russian post-revolutionary Modernism there is generally little doubt today that its protagonists were en masse pro-Communist or at least sympathized with the dominant state ideology to some degree. It appears possible, however, to offset the ideological affiliation of the last generation of Russian Modernists, namely those associated with the OBERIU circle, from the mainstream beliefs of their colleagues. With due analytical diligence, the contradictory self-referential terminology of titles like ""The Academy of Left Classicists"" or ""Three Left Hours"" can be ascertained to evince aesthetical rather than political radicalism. In public opinion, the true political views of Daniil Kharms still remain a matter of controversy. It may prove a futile endeavour to find out whether Kharms divulged any kind of truth to his NKVD interrogators. However, his own textual legacy contains paramount evidence to his clerical, monarchist, and in other ways conservative, if not at times reactionary, personal and ideological agenda. In a way, the same was true for most of his OBERIU peers, whether Vvedenskii, Zabolotskii or Vaginov.

A century and more of attribution scholarship has determined that George Peele is the author of the long opening scene of the play, but no recent editor of the play has treated the issue of co-authorship seriously and edited the opening scene with Peelean, rather than Shakespearean, parallels in mind. However, all editors of the play must confront the many difficult editorial cruces in the scene, not least those involving staging. One particularly troublesome passage involves Titus's killing of his son, Mutius. Building upon evidence for Peele's authorship of the opening scene, Brian Boyd proposed that this murder was a late addition by Peele after Shakespeare had written the rest of the play.

This should be surprising as, beginning with the first Wexford, From Doon with Death in 1964, her work, whether writing as Rendell or Vine, is without exception comprised of layers of narrative complexity, literary references, and textual mosaics. This article, through its analysis of Rendell's first three novels, From Doon with Death, To Fear a Painted Devil, and Vanity Dies Hard, will explore the centrality of texts and textuality within her work, from the minutiae and range of texts that form her mosaic of clues, to the centrality of the acts of reading and writing, but most importantly to the revelation of the extent that the novels are steeped in literary knowledge and understanding, and the extent to which Rendell's readers should equal that knowledge and understanding to fully engage with the narrative process.",48,"WOS:000398033400002",3

In this paper I challenge this interpretation and argue that the political pressures of the later 1930s seeped or forced themselves into her short fiction and, further, that several of her most interesting stories were directly instigated by and concerned with contemporary political and social questions.

There is no interest in the landscapes where the actions which are the only concerns of this genre take place. However, landscape features such as mountains, the sea, trees, caves or the sky are perceptible in the system of the kennings, yet only as more or less abstract ideas. They mostly lack congruence within their semantic and situational contexts as is shown by the examples of kennings for 'earth' and 'sea'. However, a more inclusive research shows that there are images of landscapes that may be called metaphorical or mythical. These may be conceptualized as different types: (1) The emotional state of individual characters can be projected on to landscapes (e.g. Hallfreor, Olafs Erfidrapa 19). (2) The inner space of a human being can be depicted as a landscape. This is the case in countless kennings for, breast' used as metaphors for the insides of a human being, found most frequently in various kennings for 'poetry'. (3) Descriptions of sea-voyages on the turbulent sea are situated at the border of real and mythical landscapes in as much as the sea may be depicted as a threatening monster ready to devour the ship (e.g. Refr Gestsson, Feroavisur). Alternatively, the storm that generates the churning sea may be personified as a giant (Egill Skallagrimsson, Lausavisa 23).

It was also the first of his works to be filmed. This is noteworthy given the novel's cinematic self-awareness and the writer's overt interest in acting and cinema, which he has reiterated over the years. Cinema, as a subject matter and a distinctive artistic language, resurfaces time and again in the pages of Rushdie's essays, short stories, novels, and other writings. As many critics have pointed out, the writer's emotional connection to cinema has translated into cinema itself being put to work as a mediating device in his oeuvre, with his characters often making sense of themselves and the world -and coming to terms with their own place in it - through cinema. In this article, we examine the three existing adaptations of Midnight's Children, with particular emphasis on the 2012 film, in view of their discursively constructed audiences. We consider these adaptations from the point of view of the audience, and how they engage with the spectator/reader. Our analysis is supplemented by Rushdie's essays on the acts of adaptation and translation from one artistic medium to another. Our purpose is not to measure the failure or success of Rushdie's and Mehta's adaptation (although an aesthetic evaluation would indeed be of interest); we argue instead that the film adaptation is a protracted creative project that has taken into consideration, more than previous adaptations of the novel, not only new forms of representation and new ways of reading, but also new ways of engaging its constructed audiences.",71,"WOS:000412099400007",3
"English",,,"It is well known that the sixteenth century's surge of vernacular biblical translation was enabled by a greater knowledge of Greek and Hebrew. But by the century's end, the most exciting work on these languages had far surpassed issues of comprehension.

Despite the significant implications such work had for vernacular translation, the relationship between these two fields has rarely been explored. This article will offer a preliminary study by using new evidence relating to the biblical scholarship and translation efforts of the English Hebraist Hugh Broughton (1549-1612). It will demonstrate how the theories and methods he developed in the course of his own research into Apostolic Greek were not only central to his vision of the English Bible, but also affected such details of translation as style and lexical choice.

In contrast, the authors propose the following: (1.) The relation between the same two concepts/domains can, in principle, be either bidirectional or unidirectional. Hence, even if there is a conceptual asymmetry between the metaphor concepts/domains (so that one of them is a better candidate for being assigned the source function than the other), this conceptual asymmetry in itself might not be sufficient to trigger a unidirectional mapping process. (2) Among those two potential relations, the bidirectional one is more basic than the unidirectional, in that it can be triggered by the mere presence of the two stimuli; in contrast, the unidirectional process requires an additional mechanism for it to be fully realized. The authors survey and analyze several empirical findings that can be accounted for by this proposal.

His father, Philip, constructed an idealised son who listens intently to his lectures about God's Creation. Likewise, in her evangelical tracts, his mother Emily depicted young Gosse responding obediently to Christian discipline. Even in Gosse's Life of Philip Henry Gosse (1890), the father's voice dominates the son's authorship, despite the latter's occasional criticisms and veiled allusions. It was in Father and Son that Gosse finally asserted his freedom from those parental discourses that had defined his persona and determined his prospects. Gosse's struggle to extricate himself from the legacy of textual family enmeshment produced a work of generic, linguistic, narrative, and allusive complexity.

This essay argues that through the self-conscious assumption of bachelor pseudonyms, the Salmagundi editors' aggressively masculine domestic retreat can be read as a reaction to the insufficiently reductive categories of a literary culture increasingly organized by gender difference. Even as the Salmagundi bachelor-editor's mock the performative virtue of feminine domesticity, their own humorous social critique works to reestablish the possibility of making reform feel in tune with natural impulses. The bachelors locate the source of their imaginative whimsy within the domestic sphere's supposed transcendence of social artifice and market pressures, but they also claim authorship by distinguishing their imaginative output from the termagant's domestic labor. Because the editors' reformative project depends on readers recognizing the alienated bachelor as a humorous literary type, the hostile relationship to its readers that has earned Salmagundi a place in narratives of Irving's protoromanticism actually signals a collaborative relationship with readers who are repeatedly forced to acknowledge the editors' authorial design.",51,"WOS:000399066000001",3

While several national poets involved in national movements showed a ""vernacular"" tendency (Terian), Schiller and Goethe represented the more ""cosmopolitan"" model of a national classic. Such 'affiliation' to the universal aesthetic canon is also characteristic of the politics of Slovenian romantic movement and its poet, France Preseren. Although Preseren's poetry, which was exposed to Austrian censorship, only sparsely employs an explicit political discourse, his imaginary worlding and intertextual transfer of universal aesthetic repertoires from the established literatures into a Habsburg periphery fashioned a cosmopolitan strategy of cultural nationalism. Preseren has been venerated in Slovenia since the late 19th-century as the singular national classic whose oeuvre compensates for the apparent lack of classical and modern traditions in Slovenian and deserves to be recognized worldwide.",38,"WOS:000403818800002",3

"English",,,"Jean-Luc Nancy's thought consistently positions itself against political forms grounded in ideas of essence or belonging. Accordingly, it sometimes portrays the concept of identity in a negative light, tending instead to gesture towards the ontological exposure at the heart of any political configuration. This tendency has led critics to claim that Nancy regards identity as a priori disastrous and to be dismissed outright. Nonetheless, a careful reading of Nancy's work reveals a recurring preoccupation with the question of collective identity. As this article suggests, Nancy's critique is directed less against identity as such than the 'infinite identity' that would bestow a totalizing 'work' on the collective. Indeed, Nancy constantly insists that politics cannot do without some degree of identity or figure, however skeletal. The question we must then ask is how we are to conceive this minimal figuration. One way of approaching such a figuration, I shall argue, lies in Nancy's treatment of the proper name. This article develops Nancy's thinking of identity and the name, showing how it allows us to think a limited coherence of the collective - here of a 'people' - in a way that nevertheless resists its closure, ultimately to think identity as this resistance.",33,"WOS:000413760100005",3

Yet The Invisible Worm is also a contemporary example of the Irish Big House novel, a genre that articulates the identitarian, historical and social plights of the Anglo-Irish. My intention in this article is to consider how the narrative's evident interest in the personal dimension of Laura's traumas works to obviate the socio-historical and political elements that have also contributed to the protagonist's predicament. I will also analyse the different treatment afforded to the individual and the collective past: while the novel is explicit and optimistic in the case of Laura's personal story, it remains reluctant to speak out about historical evils, with the result that, at the end of the novel, although freed from her personal traumas, Laura remains the prisoner of her historical legacy.",33,"WOS:000404460200009",3

His literary corpus is studded with descriptions of paintings, sculptures, photographs, ceremonial statues, murals, and other, more obscure pieces of urban flotsam given their own artistic agency in his fecund imagination. This article discusses his interest and entanglement in art from a threefold perspective: thematically, biographically, and theoretically. It argues that the art world has consistently functioned as a laboratory for the author to refine his thoughts, albeit as a literary writer, not an art critic. While Vladislavic does not identify as an art critic, this article argues that his writing on art and broader literary output represent a valuable critical resource and an important intervention in fervid and unresolved debates around the definition of art criticism. The article begins by identifying thematic constellations that recur throughout Vladislavic's work, placing these in conversation with salient aspects of the author's early professional biography.

Capital comes across as a 'social novel' in the nineteenth-century sense: as a panorama of social types and narrative trajectories. It is precisely this conventional mode of presentation (and its tradition of social critique) that enables Lanchester's novel to trace what risk, with both its positive and negative implications, means for the various characters whose lives before and after the 2008 crash it follows. Capital thus exposes reckless capitalism but also explores many other meanings that risk and risk-taking can have in globalised urban settings of the twenty-first century.

"English",,,"Jose Eduardo Agualusa's My Father's Wives celebrates a liberation of the strictures usually underpinning identity construction, by both affirming those notions and simultaneously undercutting their validity. The novel proposes a textual and cultural celebratory promiscuousness as way of reimagining a Creole identity that goes beyond the customary dual poles of Portugal and Angola to embrace most of Southern Africa as well as Asia. The contradictions spawned by this strategy open up a gap that is filled with signs of excess and slippage, the result of a parodic mimicry and the failure of the paternal function at the textual and personal levels. Structured around the search for Faustino Manso and his alleged seventeen children, the discovery of his infertility empties out his paternal function and puts into doubt the Lusotropical stereotype of Creoleness. This geocultural polyphony is replicated at the textual level with the presence of an unnamed narrator-figure whose metatextual narrative serves as authorial framing for the fictional text. However, the replication of the fictional narrative within the authorial text with some seepage of the latter into the former again points to both mimicry and excess. This paper will argue that by emptying the two vectors structuring the text of their narrative objectives, My Father's Wives constitutes the doubly absent paternities of a Luandan Creole stereotype typically projected over the rest of the nation.",35,"WOS:000404162900009",3

In addition, the scattered and scant remarks on his drawings in secondary literature classify as uninformed Conrad's competence as a draftsman and his general understanding of visual art. Yet, as I argue here, Conrad was a skilled amateur visual artist and his drawings use a painterly technique, a method that is conceptually difficult and that defines visual impressionism. Conrad's drawing technique is, furthermore, similar to aspects of his impressionistic writing style. The drawings, like his texts, demonstrate a capacity for describing things indirectly using ` negative space' (focusing on the background to illustrate the subject), as if his drawings were a visual equivalent of applying a writing technique to the drawing board.

The analysis highlights the structural importance of absurdist humour both for the narrative structure of the novel as well as for a reader's understanding and interpretation of Catch-22. The article illustrates that resolution can be achieved, contrary to the generally espoused viewpoint in humour studies, and that it is realised at the moment of interpretation.

"English","Victorian feminism; women's life writing; spiritual autobiography; John Grey of Dilston; Catharine of Siena",,"Josephine Butler, controversial and pioneering feminist reformer of the late nineteenth century, never wrote an autobiography, but she articulated self-understandings indirectly through writing deeply self-reflexive constructions of others' lives. While this strategy has been recognised in isolated biographies, I show Butler's auto/biography as a serial process, comparing John Grey of Dilston with Catharine of Siena to show how Butler's conceptions of herself changed significantly in the early part of her career. She moves from modelling herself on the gender-transcendent liberal reformer, to modelling herself on the radical female prophet, whose sex was a vital qualification for spiritual and political power. Finding she could no longer position her feminist campaign within the broad cause of Victorian liberal reform, Butler turned from her paternal examplar to a medieval female saint-prophet, whose authority was located in her outsider status and in her intrinsically womanly nature. This comparative discussion, enlightened by reference to Butler's unpublished letters, shows Butler's change from positioning her public work within the reform tradition of liberalism to that of apocalyptic feminism. It also sheds a new light on Victorian women's coded strategies of self-representation, and more generically into the use of sequential biographies as vehicles for articulating changing self-conceptions.",39,"WOS:000399578600004",3

Whilst the novels echo the nationally shared distrust for what is considered to be a system that is dysfunctional and that deserves to be critiqued and contested, the essays encourage readers to embrace a consensual, positive view of the principles of justice. The main contention in this contribution is that the apparently resigned portrayal of a flawed justice system found in the novels contains the same desire and points to the same social and ethical perspective as the essays.

From the pre-credit sequence, in which the grieving Macbeths are seen burning the body of their dead baby on a funeral pyre, to the closing coda, in which young Fleance returns like an avenging fury to challenge the crown, they provide a crucial interpretative framework for reading this latest cinematic adaptation. It is an interpretation, moreover, that presents the child as a complex and contradictory nexus of hopes, fears and anxieties. Not merely innocent victims, the children of Kurzel's Macbeth are both pitiful and terrifying. This portrayal of childhood has its roots in a tradition beginning in the last three decades of the twentieth century, when directors focused increasingly on the children in this play. In this paper, I will begin with the last major English-language film of Macbeth by Roman Polanski (1971) and track the dramatic treatment of the children through to Kurzel's 2015 release, locating the shift in focus within a larger socio-historical context of changing attitudes towards the role and identity of children more generally.

Its anecdotal examples (the graceful adolescent who becomes fatally self-conscious, the fencing bear) probe the critical borderline between the unreflective and the reflective. Such arguments and anecdotes may be understood in relation to notions drawn from modern cognitive neuroscience and psychology, such as motor resonance, kinesis, intentionality, and the perception of 'life'. Kleist's intervention in the prehistory of these questions, however, remains essential: his imaginative way of approaching them induces the reader to see the problem, to encounter it as already embodied, rather than as the result of a set of scientific or indeed philosophical propositions.",14,"WOS:000415686600011",3

To better understand the relationship between knowledge sharing and field organization, I examine a small but influential movement within the culinary arts known as ""modernist cuisine."" This movement eschews many of the protective practices that have traditionally guarded culinary innovations in favor of an open sharing model similar to how knowledge is shared in the sciences or open source software development. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and other primary resources, I find that this open mode of knowledge sharing precipitates a system of peer-based citation, whereby producers receive direct recognition for their discoveries without the endorsement of traditional tastemakers such as restaurant critics. This citation-based prestige system opens the culinary field to participation from new kinds of actors, generates new roles that are better insulated from the economic demands of traditional restaurant work, and may even influence the field's traditional status hierarchy. These findings suggest that the way knowledge is shared plays a considerable role in the organization of fields where expertise and innovation are highly valued, and that changes in these practices can have other consequences in the field at large.

Through interviews with over 70 consumers dissatisfied with Hallyu across these three nations, this project identifies three main areas under which this potential for a Hallyu ""backlash"" occurs: perceptions of colonial-esque attitudes and cultural imperialism from Korea; the movement of Hallyu from an innovative new ""high culture"" to a static and out-of-date ""low culture""; and the increasing availability of new and different international products that threaten to usurp Hallyu.

"English",,,"Lady Mary Wroth's The Countess of Montgomery's Urania is tantalizing both with regard to its content and production. Equally fascinating are Wroth's handwritten corrections in the so-called Kohler copy of the printed first part (1621) and the manuscript continuation. The amount of extant authorial correction is exceptional for a writer of the period, but the lack of contextual information makes it difficult to assess Wroth's revisions. While the corrections may not definitively disclose who the Kohler copy was destined for or whether the manuscript was a working draft or a fair copy, they do bring to light a number of Wroth's revision habits and concerns. An analysis of the distribution of Wroth's corrections to the Kohler copy reveals her concern over individual episodes that contain autobiographical or topical references. A comparison of Wroth's corrections to those of her contemporary William Davenporte in his copy of Urania further supports this insight. Examining Wroth's emendations of the manuscript continuation likewise suggests that Wroth's revisions of her work were intermittent, occurring at different stages of the writing process. Furthermore, her interventions reveal a concern with legibility, the addition of clarifying and extra detail, with stylistic effects and the affective impact of her text.

"English",,,"Language can be made to revolt against its own instrumentality. That is the promise Algernon Charles Swinburne pursues in his unfinished novel Lesbia Brandon, composed in 1859-67 but not published until 1952. Early on in this work, we encounter a passage that perfectly showcases his peculiar and innovative prose style. It is a style that boldly invents its own mechanism of self-perpetuation, and, as it ramifies throughout the novel, turns the text into something other than a conventional narrative - a singular grammar of sensuous perception. The novel's young protagonist, Herbert Seyton, has rounded a corner of a coastal road and comes face to face with the sea. Lesbia Brandon is full of descriptions of the natural environment like this one. It is one of many moments in the novel in which characters encounter, experience, and merge with the seascape. These instances concatenate Swinburne's formal project throughout Lesbia Brandon, a project of translating forces that create patterns in the perceived world into models for prose. The resulting stylistic transformation extends not only to the figurative aspects of Swinburne's language but also to its grammatical and syntactic underpinnings, as peripheral, accessory elements become core shaping forces in the prose. This process is at work as Herbert rejoices in the sea-coast and all its enchantments: <disp-quote> The long reefs that rang with returning waves and flashed with ebbing ripples; the smooth slopes of coloured rock full of small brilliant lakes that fed and saved from sunburning their anchored fleets of flowers, yellower lilies and redder roses of the sea; the sharp and fine sea-mosses, fruitful of grey blossom, fervent with blue and golden bloom, with soft spear-heads and blades brighter than fire; the lovely heavy motion of the stronger rock-rooted weeds, with all their weight afloat in languid water, splendid and supine; the broad bands of metallic light girdling the greyer flats and swaying levels of sea without a wave; all the enormous graces and immeasurable beauties that go with its sacred strength; the sharp delicate air about it, like breath from the nostrils and lips of its especial and gracious god; the hard sand inlaid with dry and luminous brine; the shuddering shades of sudden colour woven by the light with the water for some remote golden mile or two reaching from dusk to dusk under the sun; shot through with faint and fierce lustres that shiver and shift; and over all a fresher and sweeter heaven than is seen inland by any weather; drew his heart back day after day and satisfied it. (196-97; ch. 2) </disp-quote> This description consists of just one sentence, containing 209 words and eleven semicolon-separated fragments. With its great length and accumulation of clauses alone, this passage announces that Swinburne's narrative practice will warp the dimensions of prose, stretching its habitual units, the sentence and the paragraph, beyond their usual span. This sentence is remarkable for its almost complete absence of verbs. Almost every one of its verbs (rang, flashed, fed, saved, go, shiver, shift) appears in a subordinate, defining clause that elaborates on the seascape's features. These verbs, for example, add specificity to the long reefs that rang with returning waves and flashed with ebbing ripples, point to the small lakes that fed and saved from sunburning, define the immeasurable beauties that go with [the sea's] sacred strength, and name the lusters that shiver and shift. At the sentence's conclusion, two predicates finally reveal its raison d'etre in terms of plot: the wonders of the sea drew his heart back day after day and satisfied it. These are the events that motivate the description of the sea, but for most of the sentence's unfolding they are eclipsed, bowled over by the shimmering grammatical elaboration. Swinburne insistently adds adjectives to his nouns, singly and in multiples: long reefs, returning waves, sharp slopes, small brilliant lakes, blue and golden bloom, sharp delicate air, dry and luminous brine, faint and fierce lustres. Sometimes the adjectives are comparatives (yellower lilies and redder roses), and at others Swinburne piles adjectives all around a noun, surrounding it in a halo of modifiers, as in the sharp and fine sea-mosses, fruitful, the hard sand inlaid, and sudden colour woven. The adjectival imperative is so strong that it infiltrates and dilutes the verbs' efficacy to signal action. In addition to the defining verbs (that rang, that fed, that go, that shiver and shift), two more verbs appear near the end of the passage in the form of the participles girdling and reaching. These do not name events but rather describe an enduring arrangement of broad bands of metallic light and a recurrent effect of water and light reaching from dusk to dusk. They, too, contribute to the adjectival mode that dominates this prose.",22,"WOS:000400962200003",3

In a chronological survey from the late eighteenth to the late twentieth centuries, this article begins with the role Sterne reception plays in the German cult of sensibility (Empfindsamkeit) before focusing in turn on Hegel, Schopenhauer, Marx, Nietzsche, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, Lukacs and Luhmann. Superior philosophical stylists such as Schopenhauer, Marx, Nietzsche and the early Lukacs succumbed to the temptation to imitate surface features of Sterne's style, but the most interesting cases arise when philosophers have spent time reflecting on Sterne's thematic concerns as well as his formal innovations. There have been three main areas of interest: Sterne's characterisations and the question of peculiar individuality, Sterne as a sentimentalist and moralist, and Shandyan humour'. An attempt is made to distinguish between philosophers (such as Wittgenstein) who merely enjoyed reading Sterne, and those (such as Marx, Nietzsche and Luhmann) who can be described as more properly Sternean'.",42,"WOS:000395155000005",3

More specifically, the idea of the mystery of iniquity is fundamental to Melville's tragic view of life. In Paul's letter, the mystery of iniquity refers to the radical deceit unleashed by God upon the world before the return of Christ, a force that makes humans particularly susceptible to delusion.

But the shift from the novels to the memoir seems greater than the shifts within the novels, as Rushdie appears to reject the novels' attempts at sympathy with his opponents.

Since the essential action in Greek drama relies on discourse and verbal interaction, its form appealed to both Shaw and Heaney, who are remembered today as masters of the spoken word.

The double aesthetics of the sublime, in particular, proves to be a congenial creative (and critical) approach to these fear- and awe-inspiring landscapes, which have been forged and shaped by technology and industry. In my essay I want to show how twenty-first century Canadian and Nigerian writers have responded to the effects of oil mining in their respective countries by drawing on notions of the sublime as they came to be articulated by Edmund Burke in the eighteenth century and have been taken up by scholars in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

The two writers diverged on whether the social goods of self-motivated action should be recognized, ultimately, as virtuous deeds.

In such a project, the local and contextual aspects of the archive would be taken into account not just as contingent factors but as part of the exercise of calibrating the cultural reach of cognition: what it is capable of, and its constraints, in different local ecologies.

I begin by discrediting myths linking creativity and mental illness in order to destabilise a traditional view of confessional poetry as generated by individual pathology, before going on to theorise the phenomenological lacuna in authorial subjectivity that such myths represent in relation to the potent technologies of poiesis.

Although eroticized female friendship approaches the ideal of a consensual and sensual partnership, intimate relations between women seem best to thrive in a separatist environment removed from courtly social and economic exchanges, including the marital negotiations crucial to cementing dynastic and political alliances.

The London it presents hides secreted lives, yet it also requires the repression of empathetic affective responses to the lives of others. As I argue in this paper, the metropolis allows the narrator to enjoy urban life while remaining unaffected by its everyday traumas: she is not a hypersensitive urban observer in this city, but a disillusioned psychogeographer who opts for indifference in order to survive in the metropolis. Instead of offering alternative possibilities, as de Certeau believed in ""Walking in the City,"" walking produces a controlled and indifferent vision of the city in London Observed: it appears as an act that re-inscribes new narratives upon repressed stories. When read from today's post-millennial vantage, we might discern how Lessing's collection presciently suggests that the British capital, from the late 1980s onwards, was becoming not only a more visibly gendered and multicultural place, but also an indifferent and apathetic city, habitable at the price of declining empathy.",29,"WOS:000415826900005",3

Therefore Lorca's ballads do not issue from a narrator, strictly speaking, but from a voice that is standing in for a juglar and which I term a textual balladeer. This figure transmits textual fragments (as analysis of the Burla de don Pedro a caballo' suggests) which are revived by a balladeer's imposing voice. It is all illusion but, as we see in the Romance sonambulo', Lorca conceives of the ballad as the performance of a powerful voice which can cast such illusions. Therefore, the article examines sound patterning in concert with metre as a way for the textual balladeer to develop voice's agency. Lorca's divided soul, nostalgic for orality but grounded in textuality, is considered.",53,"WOS:000404257400005",3

In telling their story, however, he exercises the same exclusion that once relegated the Cricks to the historical periphery. Self-appointed family chronicler, Crick imposes narrative representation as the only way to exert one's historical agency. Yet his half-brother Dick's suicide, which emerges as an impenetrable silence, brings the account to an abrupt end, revealing the representational inadequacy of Crick's project of historical restoration while, ironically, inaugurating a new horizon of possibility for the narrator's life.",28,"WOS:000416779900011",3

The aim of this article is to challenge this traditional commonplace, by resituating Bertrand's collection in its own time, the 1820s and 1830s, and by studying the compositions of Gaspard de la Nuit within the context of wider, contemporary Romantic experimentation.

Because of her stylistic and conceptual innovation, Erdrich's early work provoked controversy.

The article traces this process of creating community through telling first diatopically, by exploring forms and practices of narrating in different contexts and cultures, and then diachronically, by focusing on what makes a story a 'good' story in different periods of time. Drawing on pragmatic and functionalist theories of language and literature, it attempts to show that the idea of a story that is 'worth it' - or, as for that, 'relatable' - is largely dependent precisely upon the story's 'relation' to its users and, by extension, to its embedding culture as well as to its point in time.",43,"WOS:000417177900002",3

Using the small and relatively insular fandom devoted to the English history plays, I consider fan authors' approaches to female characters in particular, and related issues of gender and sexuality, as a test case for studying fanfiction not just as a creative response to Shakespeare, but also as a critical lens through which marginalised groups can engage with the plays.",74,"WOS:000405718900002",3

Seeking to further this point of reflection, this paper engages the Hegelian theory of freedom in relation to the Dionysian myth of irrationality as a paradigm for examining the ironical attitude of power in Nwokedi. It interrogates the lure of power and the attempt to reinvent primordial human blood ritual in the play. Nwokedi's positive riot of perversity, set against a politician's economics of exploitation results in the death-drive that commands its beholder to relish human annihilation at that point where the opposition between law and personal desire is most dramatically dismantled' (Eagleton).

Departing from these trends, in this paper I analyse the use of unorthodox capital letters in 96 of his experimental poems. My aim is twofold: to identify the processes present in Cummings' unconventional use of capital letters and to determine the effects observable in such unusual patterns. The analysis reveals that the foregrounding of capitals is materialized by the insertion of initial caps, middle caps, final caps, all caps or mixed caps where these are not expected or required. It also suggests that these unconventional patterns mainly emphasize certain elements within the poems, produce iconic effects, generate wordplay and create chaotic scenes. To a lesser degree, they also schematize words, lines or a whole poem, and reproduce differences in the tone of some poetic voices or depict elements that are capitalized in real life.",51,"WOS:000415753300002",3

In all three filmic titles, a single persona is highlighted, suggesting a directorial tilt away from the thematic and towards the subjective, with women characters being lent a centralizing significance through an emphasis on gendered spaces, female bodies, and expressions of same-sex desire. Accessing Shakespeare thus, the films place a new imaginative spin on some of the central motifs of the comedies and purposefully invite engagement with performance-centred actions and plot lines. Part of this project involves interrogating the conventional endings of the comedies, and the trilogy is equally interested in testing and exposing expected generic conclusions. More broadly, the 'Shakespeare-ida' demonstrates how Shakespeare functions either as extract/abbreviation or in multiple combinations. Working through a range of texts, and combining texts, the trilogy affords enabling representations and new Shakespearean applications.",45,"WOS:000407110700004",3

"English",,,"Measure for Measure has evoked much critical disquiet and discontent, especially regarding the Duke's theatricality and seeming displacement of justice by mercy in the drama's final act. Given both the biblical discourse alluded to from Measure's title and thenceforth, and the influence of the Reformation upon the early modern theatrum mundi, this essay engages with these responses through a theologically inflected frame. I argue that, as a play-actor, it is not the want of justice in the Duke's actions but his inability to clearly see the signs of and enact genuine mercy that may account for the dis-ease he and his theatre engenders. In a dual sense, the Duke is a hypocrite. This suggests significant parallels with his obviously hypocritical Deputy: in Measure, their mutual hypocrisy is exposed by the hermeneutic condition of the law. Moreover, their hypocrisy impedes their perception of mercy and its archetypedivine mercythat, as explicated by the reformers, is itself unsettling and requires a reversal in humanity's way of seeing.",35,"WOS:000399480800001",3

Hammond, by turns a stable boy, jockey, servant to French nobles, European traveller, convert to Catholicism, itinerant circus rider, and entertainment entrepreneur, did all he could to educate himself and made a habit of seizing unlikely opportunities for adventure. He documents his Cambridgeshire childhood and his youthful travels through France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Hammond lavishly illustrated his Memoirs with his own amateur works and with line drawings commissioned from a professional artist. In this essay, Boulukos offers a few compelling samples of Hammond's work, makes the case for the significance of Hammond's text, and offers a brief account of the manuscript and its provenance. Boulukos reflects on the difficulty of introducing a previously unknown author from the eighteenth century, and on the challenges and rewards of editing and publishing such a significant manuscript discovery given today's publishing climate.",2,"WOS:000398800300006",3

This paper analyzes the description of emotions, with a particular focus on metaphors of love and anger, in extracts from the novels Kiu [Thirst], by the Zanzibarian author Mohamed Suleiman (1972), and Dar es Salaam Usiku [Dar es Salaam by Night] by the Tanzanian author Ben Mtobwa (1989).

Tracing Dia's migration across the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, the novel enables us to read the two ocean worlds together and challenges conceptualizations of both African and Indian diasporas. But while the novel recuperates intersecting histories of the Indian and Atlantic Ocean worlds, it also posits forgetting them altogether in order for its characters to carve out an alternate present in which they can live together as a community, a present that lies outside of the idea of the nation and its attendant categories of race, ethnicity, and ancestral origins.",20,"WOS:000404162900008",3
"English","Heterotopias; Digital media; Database; Transformation; Mapping; Molecular system of the human organism",,"Michel Foucault characterized heterotopias as specific spaces which disrupt and overturn our existing systems, the hitherto valid order of things and also our ways of thinking. They are significantly important particularly from the point of view of culture, since they affect cultural dynamic transformations. The author in her contribution points out that we presently discover such specific spaces mainly by means of modern technologies. Regarding digital media, the database a collection of digital data has a heterotopic character; it neutralizes the present forms of orders and preferences. Images, sounds and words are loosened from their indexicality and are converted into numerical code, which enables the modification and combination of the obtained data. The database thus represents a new type of space which subverts the standard organization of signs. Modern technologies also unveil other unconventional spaces of our micro and macro worlds. The newest medical technologies such as ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging penetrate through the surface of the human body into the depths of biological structures in order to obtain their image, and they indeed make the molecular system of the human organism visible. This molecular system can be characterized by high complexity, multifunctionality and highly variable interactions, and the medical technologies in a certain way contribute to the fact that our forms of knowledge are constantly enhanced, extended and sometimes even refuted. This current expansion of heterotopia corresponds with Foucault's opinion that every epoch creates its own spaces which strive to gain their legitimacy. It is interesting that in both cases of the above-mentioned examples of heterotopia the data transformation can be seen as a significant form of their element arrangement, and thus the borders not only between semiotic systems but also between scientific and artistic discourses are gradually wiped out.",23,"WOS:000414234700002",3

This paper explores how Houellebecq uses religious conversion in the novel as a literary metaphor for quantum uncertainty. By lacing the patchwork plot with ambiguity and satire, Houellebecq tries to reconcile the random and predetermined elements of human actions, given the physical reality of our atom-based world and existence. Against the background of his selfish male and female characters, Houellebecq plays with the possibility of transcending the pitifulness of the contemporary human condition, which both he and his characters ultimately achieve not through religion but through fiction.

The article aims to illuminate and discuss this underrated novel in terms of some of its modernist attributes by relating the work conceptually to the works of great modernist writers, particularly T.S. Eliot and E.M. Forster, in order to demonstrate its impressive literary scope and density of meaning. While there are direct allusions to Eliot's poetry in the text, it is a certain sensibility and perspective that reminds the reader forcibly of Eliot's vision, particularly in The Waste Land (1922) and The Hollow Men (1925). Eliot's image of the ""Unreal city"", derived from Baudelaire's Les sept veillards, is particularly pertinent. A number of modernist concerns or themes are addressed in this context, in particular the ambiguous merits and value of the aesthetic, social alienation, the city and the concept of Forster's ""eternal moment"" (his equivalent to Joyce's ""epiphany"", Virginia Woolf's ""moment of being"" and Eliot's ""moment in and out of time"") as a possible means of salvation in the face of the meaninglessness of a spiritually and emotionally arid, modern existence.",23,"WOS:000406439000006",3

Considering the political climate and restrictions in cinematic production, I argue that Midi Z's films highlight the inextricable connection between cultural and economic precarity of the subjects depicted. Rather than being simply documentary or fiction, Midi Z's Burma Trilogy occupies an interstitial space that allows for the remaking of identity that considers economic stratification and cultural negotiation. From depicting the lives of a scooter taxi driver, human traffickers, and drug dealers among others, the films emphasize the ways in which marginalized communities can co-opt structures of power and develop their own means of power even under oppressive regimes. Precarity does not simply serve as a limitation and is, instead, a position that is at once marginal but capable of reconfiguring cultural hegemonies. Though their Sinophone Burmese representation, Midi Z's films critique what it means to be Chinese. Thus, Chineseness is under constant negotiation in the Burma Trilogy through the characters' relationships with their own ethnic identities, overturning the understanding of Chineseness as a shared identity that flattens local inflections and differences and focuses on the confluences of subjective identities and economic exchange.",44,"WOS:000417475000002",3

Reading Sanz in the context of the tumultuous events and swirling opinions in Venezuela, I analyse the advantages and limitations of the student as a conceptual frame for the newly independent republic. I argue that the teacher-student gap that twentieth-century critics identified as an essential trope for the rhetoric of educational reform is embedded in the discourse of Sanz and his contemporaries.

The copresence of polarized historical periods in Milton's work remains a distinguishing feature; examples from preceding and succeeding periods make the case for recognizing in Milton a pivotal moment in English literary history and the history of ideas. In major fictions and narrations Milton's poetry apperceives, thematizes, and embodies-prehensively, as it were-a unique occasion of historical change, as if from BC to AD: from John Dee to Robert Boyle, or from occult correspondences and secret world-connecting sympathies, to mechanical operations, controlled and repeatable experiments, and measurement-based, post-Baconian science. Milton's Eve sins as the world's first experimentalist and in effect breaks the World-Soul's cosmic heart: even as Spenser's Agape had previously re-created it allegorically, Neoplatonically, and metaphysically, and as philosophies of social consensus and psychologies of empathetic affect recollected it sentimentally and benevolently.

The textual fragmentation principle is exactly what activates the reader's engagement in the process of (re) constitution and (re) construction of meaning. Kovac's poetical principles rise from his commitment to reality, the reader, and the literary text.

It was not only the choice of narrative forms but also that of the topic that marks Kovac's text as open to those forms of social life placed on the margins of society and exposed to repression. Kovac builds up ironic outlines of the codes of socio-cultural milieus and of all the forms of social power, providing a parodic image of social morality based on subversive mechanisms and partial truths. The social, political, ideological, religious, ethic, and aesthetic models of the world through which one perceives reality are established in the absence of emancipated action and choice.

A too-ready acceptance of this hypothetical identification has unduly influenced the study of the poem, discouraging investigation into the poetic significance of the topography of the battlefield.

However, Augustine's dualism complements a notion of the saeculum the current age as a time of intractable mixedness.

On the one hand, this led to the radicalisation of black politics in the country. The silencing of political voices after the Sharpeville massacre saw scores and scores of activists either in jail, under house arrest or in exile. Development in South Africa suffered a great blow with talented men and women who had to endure suffering in jail or exile. In other words, the cream of society was banished and South Africa as a society suffered materially and intellectually during this period. Nelson Mandela is one example of a leader from the oppressed section of society who was removed from society for over three decades. South African development would have reached a different level had the minority whites not reacted differently to urbanisation as a global phenomenon.

Based on selective textual evidence it is argued that they were not quite as basic originally, that they typically survived and developed in regional centres far away from the French-dominated court, and eventually infiltrated the area in and around late medieval London owing to its growing attraction as an economic and intellectual centre.

Before praising Parkman's efforts at the end of the review, he attacks the book on two separate fronts. The review's second (and by far its most well known) section deplores Parkman's disparagements of Native Americans. The opening paragraphs charge Parkman's title with deceit, as there was ""nothing about California or Oregon in the book.""While this opening section has been neglected in critical engagements with the review, Melville's titular quibble reveals a concern with the disingenuous tactics by which authors and publishers exacerbated Americans' obsession with California. After briefly discussing the latter two sections of ""Mr. Parkman's Tour,""this essay focuses on the opening section and its poignant critique of promotional rhetorics surrounding the 1849 California Gold Rush.",42,"WOS:000397138900006",3

In contrast, this paper addresses the housing field, an important arena for the reproduction of social inequality. Models of housing choice often assume individuals are rational actors functioning in free markets. In contrast, scholars combining the concept of ""housing pathways"" with a Bourdieusian framework demonstrate that the state shapes housing markets, and families deploy different forms of capital to access housing. Additionally, scholars use the concept of ""elective belonging"" to understand middle class housing tastes and identities. This analysis of 68 interviews with 77 middle class adults in Santiago, Chile, finds that middle class families' differential access to family wealth and state subsidies sorts them into distinct niches in the housing market. Further, middle class families that are richest in cultural capital alternatively choose neighborhoods to display aesthetic taste, accumulate social capital, or reproduce cultural capital through children's education. Some of these patterns reflect the concept of elective belonging while others illustrate traditional strategies of social reproduction. For Chile's middle classes, extended family is an important source of housing wealth and a key influence on housing decisions (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",57,"WOS:000400726400006",3

This article aims to examine the specific case of money in Argentine crime fiction. It argues that in a number of Argentine novels dealing with crime, money is more than just a leitmotif or theme: it is a character in itself. Money has a role to play, almost a certain protagonism which, in some cases, is even titular. Furthermore, one can identify what might be called theories of money' in crime novels. Novelists are interested not just in the way that money motivates or changes people's behaviour but also in how money itself behaves. Through examining money's role in crime, novelists are asking what money actually is, a question that to this day baffles many economists. We aim, therefore, to trace a lineage in Argentine fiction of novelists who give money a central role in fictions about crime, starting with Roberto Arlt, and then moving on to more recent writers, Ricardo Piglia, Ernesto Mallo, Carlos Gamerro and Alan Pauls.",87,"WOS:000404663600007",3

"English","ambiguity; comics and graphic narrative; duck-rabbit; multistability; transmedial narratology","THEORETICAL NEUTRALITY; PERCEPTUAL PLASTICITY","Multistability refers to those moments in a narrative when readers are made aware of two mutually exclusive possibilities, conceived as an analogy to the visual illusion of the duck-rabbit, which can be seen either as a duck or as a rabbit, but not as both at the same time. Such mutually exclusive possibilities can arise from image elements that have different functions in different panels, words that refer to different things in the dialogue and the panel images, narration that can be read as either extra- or intradiegetic, or, indeed, moments of hesitation whether a metalepsis (a transgression of narrative boundaries) has taken place or not. Duck-rabbitry, that is, the tendency to create multistable moments (or instances that mimick the ""tilt"" between one percept and another), is a narrative effect in its own right and therefore needs to be distinguished from multiperspective, polyphonic narration, and allegory (because, in these cases, the two possibilities are not mutually exclusive), as well as from irony (because, in this case, one possibility is considered superior to the other). It extends across the narrative space of the fictional world, the narrative time of the plot construction, and the experience of the reader, leading to particular effects of fluency and rupture. While this article foregrounds comics as a medium that is particularly prone to duck-rabbitry, the conclusion also draws attention to its occurrence in other media and its importance for the project of transmedial narratology.",30,"WOS:000411300500006",3
"English",,"MEMORY","Museum exhibitions and memorial sites associated with Third Reich and GDR history present a unique set of historical, ethical, and curatorial challenges concerned with the representation and narration of the National Socialist and SED dictatorships from the perspective of the Gestapo, SS, and Stasi perpetrators. By developing an interpretive framework for analysing narrative perspective in memory narratives of the Third Reich and the GDR, this article explores precisely how the perpetrator perspective is constructed by the various forms of communication media and display strategies employed by a range of different statefunded and private museums, from perpetrator sites to museums of everyday life in the GDR. I suggest that the perpetrator perspective, even more than the victim perspective, enables a particularly immersive visitor experience and comprehensive understanding of the German dictatorships by presenting narratives of the National Socialist and GDR past within an approximation of their original ideological and socio-political contexts, and exposing the attitudes and behaviours of the secret police. I also examine how museums offset the effects of this perpetrator perspective by simultaneously employing distancing strategies which identify the perpetrator as an unreliable narrator, and thus aim to preclude uncritical identification and empathy with the perpetrators, prompting the visitor instead to question and challenge the perpetrator's world view and account of events. Die Ausstellungen und Gedenkstatten, die sich mit den Tatern des Dritten Reiches und der DDR befassen, stellen eine spezifische Herausfordering dar. Indem sie die Darstellung und Erzahlung der nationalsozialistischen und ostdeutschen Diktaturen aus der Perspektive der Gestapo-, SS- und Stasi- T "" ater thematisieren, werfen sie besondere historische, ethische und kuratorische Fragen auf.

Ich komme zu dem Schluss, dass die Verwendung der Taterperspektive, noch mehr als die Verwendung der Opferperspektive, einem umfassenden Besuchererlebnis und einem tieferen Verstandnis der deutschen Diktaturen dient. Diese Taterperspektive enthullt die Einstellungen und Verhaltensweisen der jeweiligen Geheimpolizei, und stellt die Erinnerungserzahlungen des Dritten Reiches und der DDR in ihrem ursprunglichen ideologischen und gesellschaftspolitischen Kontext dar. Des weiteren wird untersucht, inwieweit Museen dem Einfluss der Taterperspektive auf den Besucher durch den gleichzeitigen Einsatz von Distanzierungsstrategienentgegenwirken. Ziel dieser Distanzierungsstrategien ist es, den Tater als unzuverlassigen Erzahler zu identifizieren, um die unkritische Identifikation und Empathie des Museumbesuchers mit dem Tater zu verhindern.

Relating experiences from notably violent border cities, such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, the play performs feminicides, decapitations, civilian casualties, and cartel feuds as a way of signaling posttraumatic stressors that hold the nation captive, literally reliving and repeating senseless tragedies. From the title itself, Salcedo suggests that modern-day Mexicans hear gunfire so frequently that it has become a sort of music, a backdrop to life on the border. At the same time, the only references to music in the play are songs associated with the iconic voice of the narcocorrido genre: Chalino Sanchez, himself publicly gunned down.

In so doing, it follows the hermeneutic logic of boundary-crossing by travelling across a range of literary registers in its consideration of the witness as insider and outsider, a mobile subject that moves across the boundaries of national and cultural affiliation. It shows how exilic writing can place a high premium on the value of a writer's ruptured double agency and divided loyalty, which is offered as the alternative (and alter-native) discursive space in the absence of the voices of those who have been ""disappeared"" from the official record.",43,"WOS:000412099400005",3
"English",,"LITERARY LAWLESSNESS SOZABOY; CHILD SOLDIER; ROTTEN ENGLISH; FICTION; NATION","My article starts by disproving the established critical consensus that Ken Saro-Wiwa's Sozaboy features a child soldier. Instead, I argue, we see a tactical psychopathy at work, in which the adult soldier's flattened moral choices and fluid political affiliations become expedients to ensure his survival. As a consequence, I argue, the soldier's libidinal attachments become insecure. Correspondingly, objects in the world of Saro-Wiwa's book become animated and partially autonomous. My article turns to the autonomous partial object to pioneer a model of non-anthropocentric environmental agency, which I term an ""environmental unconscious."" I establish this argument with the help of Melanie Klein's psychoanalytic work on part-objects. Klein allows us to infer that the infant's earliest introjective identifications with the breast and its projective identifications with feces involve fantasies of consumption and pollution. These identifications contribute to the eventual making of the subject and its subsequent psychic dispositions. That is to say, the part-objects from which all of our later identifications proceed are always already enmeshed in an early environmental politics. Within this conceptual schema, the autonomous partial object (which Zizek terms an ""organ without a body"") becomes readable, in relief, as an obdurate environmental agency whose independence both retains and exceeds human attachments. Accordingly, Sozaboy's repeated emphasis on renegade organs, disembodied voices, and Mene's involuntary bodily response can be thought of as moments in which the environment speaks what the befuddled human protagonist is unable to formulate. I argue that what is articulated in such moments is the silent but ever-present legacy of oil production in the Niger Delta, which becomes something like the unconscious of Saro-Wiwa's book. Moreover, the ambivalence of Kleinian object relations allows us to sustain, without contradiction, the three mutually exclusive outcomes for Mene's mother and Agnes in Saro-Wiwa's plot. My article concludes with a reconstitutive alphabet of Sozaboy's autonomous partial objects and argues that the novel's distorted extremeties of the human amount finally to modes of environmental restitution.",46,"WOS:000435327800005",3

Robert Conley's Mountain Windsong: A Novel of the Trail of Tears (1992) needs to be read as a critique of the idea that Native American rights can be secured from within the United States' legal order. Through the jarring juxtaposition of historical legal documents and a romantic plot, the novel deconstructs the idea of domestic law as an agent of change and introduces the language of human rights as an alternative normative framework for Native resistance. Diane Glancy's Pushing the Bear: A Novel of the Trail of Tears (1996) engages with a question that figured prominently in the debates about indigenous rights, namely whether these rights can be realized within the context of a human rights regime that puts the individual center stage. On closer scrutiny, the novel opens up an alternative way of thinking about the relationship between individual and group rights. It thereby contributes to closing the theoretical gap between individual and group rights, which stymied indigenous rights debates considerably.",48,"WOS:000403843500004",3
"English",,,"My essay interprets Toni Morrison's works as 'timeless,' not so much from the perspective of their presumable universal appeal, but from that of their narrative composition, which denies established forms of temporal arrangement and facilitates new ways of textual experience. Focusing on Morrison's Trilogy (Beloved, Jazz, and Paradise), I will argue that the three novels challenge conventional ideas of history and time to create a narrative space situated in the living present. While filled with numerous references to concrete timelines, Morrison's writings also insist on a quasi-universal 'truth' that takes the reader beyond the boundaries of objective history. Beloved first limits the narrative perspective to the year 1873, but then invites its readers to embark on a virtual 'time travel' through various periods of the protagonist's life. Memories and subjective lapses back into the past dominate the narration, thus focusing on experience and imaginary time. Jazz and Paradise both situate literary 'truth' in the sentient dynamic of the reading experience. Following the claim of phenomenological theory that perception is always a kind of action in which the world appears ""afresh from the perspective of [...] 'lived' experience"" (Chaplin, A.D. [2002]. ""Phenomenology: Merleau-Ponty and Sartre."" B. Gaut and D.M. Lopes, eds. The Routledge Companion to Aesthetics. London and New York, NY: Routledge, 159), I will examine Morrison's novels as 'living events' that reconstruct the narrated occurrences as haptic experiences. Through mnemonic elements within the esthetics of her texts, Morrison transforms the novels' story time into a very subjective discourse time that engages readers immediately. In the phenomenological sense, these strategies enable us to lose ourselves in Morrison's novels and, instead of perceiving them as mere textual constructions, indulge in the illusion of ""re-achieving a direct and primitive contact with the world"" (Merleau-Ponty, Maurice (1996 [1945]).

"English",,"GENRE","My essay is premised on the observation that while canonical theories of fantastic genre fiction (fantasy, science fiction, horror) proposed by critics such as Tzetvan Todorov and Darko Suvin center on epistemic aporia, most recent examples in popular culture reject fundamental difference, alterity, and the unknown in favor of postmodern play within a limited set of generic conventions. I argue that today, tabletop roleplaying game systems (RPGs) provide a superior hermeneutic for understanding how the fantasy genre operates in mass culture than does traditional genre theory. After providing a brief overview of the historical development of fantasy gaming out of wargaming and mass market fantasy literature in the 1970s, I show how RPGs formalized fantasy's generic tropes into a modular system that enabled participants to produce fictions across and between genres. Through a reading of Poul Anderson's use of the ""multiverse"" trope in his novel Three Hearts and Three Lions, the notion that reality consists of an infinite number of interconnected worlds, I argue RPGs completed a reorientation toward the fantastic begun by mass-market fantasy literature. Epistemological concerns, distinctions between fantastic genres, and individual authorship are de-emphasized in favor of established formal conventions, a shift which encourages a participatory model of consumption and ease of transmission across diverse media. I then use the HBO adaptation of George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones novels as an example of how this paradigmatic shift in the fantastic has moved beyond the niche markets of fantasy fiction and roleplaying games to manifest itself today as a hegemonic cultural norm.",62,"WOS:000418348000007",3

Subjects constantly negotiate these conflicting ideologies in order to make a life for themselves in the metropolis.

Much literary criticism has focused on his novel Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English (1985) because it highlights the traumas experienced during the Biafran War through experimental form and pidgin English. Though Biafra was declared a homeland for the Igbo ethnic group, many others who lived within the envisioned nation-state were forced and persuaded to fight. Sozaboy details the experiences of the Ogoni people as they attempted to survive this situation. I focus on a much-over-looked aspect of Sozaboy, which contains many rich references to emerging forms of neoliberalism as assemblage, a topic usually reserved for when Saro-Wiwa organized against big oil exploitation of the Ogoni in the postwar context. This essay locates how Sozaboy persuasively identifies the period of the Biafran War as the point at which the Nigerian state and society transitioned from post-independence toward neoliberalism. Written in pidgin English, the novel bends the English language to decipher aspects of both ethnic war and an emergent neoliberalism. Formally, as a novel about the socialization of Mene, Sozaboy ruptures the generic features of a bildungsroman, is in fact anti-developmental, and demonstrates how war can refashion postcolonial subjectivities to meet the needs of globalization.

"English",,,"Objects of everyday life spinning out of control occupy an important place in modern Turkish narratives. From the prodigal sons of the first Turkish novels to the shanty town dwellers of contemporary Istanbul narratives, many characters suffer from the same malady: an inability to master, possess, and derive pleasure from objects, and a tendency to be menaced by them even as they fall under their spell. This tension between subjectivity and the everyday world of objects constitutes a prominent thematic structure in modern Turkish narratives and Tanpinar is pivotal for considering its significance and formal repercussions. His works register the cultural traumas of modernization and Westernization through his characters' impotence in their practical, symbolic, and affective relations with objects that dominate them. They also propose and perform certain modes of aestheticizing everyday life as an antidote to this impotence. The purpose of this article is to delineate how Tanpinar's novels dramatize crises of personhood in relation to objects and what these crises might reveal about the affective dimensions of ""belated modernity."" Such a consideration underlines the importance of cultural and historical contextualization in object-oriented criticism.",23,"WOS:000419063500005",3
"English",,,"Occasionally noted though rarely explored, Shelley's remarkable diversity might be considered the hallmark of his career - the one attribute by which he might best be understood and appreciated. Few authors are as wideranging: his quest for knowledge extended across the sciences and liberal arts in a manner that brings to mind the French Encyclopaedists, whom he clearly emulated. Diversity is a prominent feature of both his poetry and prose, and is exemplified by translations from six European languages as well as by a multiplicity of forms and styles in a heterogeneous body of original work, much of which has till recently remained unfamiliar or neglected. Improved newly edited texts are presently making it easier to gauge the extent of Shelley's achievement but the question remains: was it wise for Shelley to be so diverse? The article posits the view that it was in Shelley's nature to be so and that, despite concerns (expressed by Keats, amongst others) about the dispersing of his talents, it served his artistic purposes perpetually to explore different avenues of expression. This practice was in consonance with his definition of the poet, mastery of his own craft, renewal, a hybrid identity, global consciousness, self-knowledge, and his conception of thought and the universe as infinitely various. The article also shows how his creative and discursive writings are linked in a nexus of interconnections that is particularly noticeable in his draft notebooks, which exemplify the fluidity, openness, and provisionality of his compositional method.",58,"WOS:000405514400002",3

Geographical borders are mediating bodies which, for Michel de Certeau, also represent a ""parole de la limite"" [the language of limits] that concomitantly establishes communication and separation between two sides. The discursive mobility created by the border is equally and intricately linked to spatial mobility, since, as Certeau continues, the border is also ""un passage."" Instead of passing through or across a border, the protagonists of Vigo's film opt to pass along, and thus inhabit the border. Drawing on Certeau's observations on borders as productive zones, this article demonstrates a clear link between the canal-as-border and the surrealist aesthetic, while opening up a discussion of montage as an invisible, yet essential border in cinema.",11,"WOS:000423298000006",3
"English",,,"Often referenced but rarely performed, Maschinist Hopkins (1929) is one of the most prominent examples of film's influence on opera. Max Brand composed Maschinist Hopkins during the Weimar Republic, a fruitful period in both operatic and film history. By writing his own libretto, which was uncommon but not unprecedented in the post-Wagnerian generation, Brand was able to carefully detail stage directions and set designs, akin to writing a screenplay. Contemporary film inspired the musical score, plot themes, staging, and sets of the opera, but one particular film, Fritz Lang's Metropolis, may have even served as the film model for Brand. Maschinist Hopkins is representative of a general trend during the Weimar Republic, when opera was becoming increasingly inspired by film. Max Brands Oper Maschinist Hopkins ( 1929), die heute zwar noch Erwahnung findet, aber nicht mehr aufgefuhrt wird, entstand zu einem fur die Operngeschichte sehr fruchtbaren Zeitpunkt, als der Stummfilm der Weimarer Republik seinen kunstlerischen Hohepunkt erreichte. Wie viele andere Komponisten der Zeit zeigte sich auch Brand als von den technischen und asthetischen Moglichkeiten des neuen Mediums inspiriert. Da er das Libretto selbst verfasste - was in der Generation der nachwagnerischen Komponisten nicht unublich war - konnte er die Buhnenanweisungen detailliert festlegen. Schon im Titel der Oper klingt der Einfluss von Fritz Langs Metropolis ( 1927) an, und es lasst sich zeigen, dass Musik, Handlung und Buhnenbilder deutliche Parallelen zu den Gestaltungsprinzipien des Films aufweisen, was die historische Bedeutung von Maschinist Hopkins als Denkmal der Zeit unterstreicht.",21,"WOS:000398059400005",3

An examination of the few preterite and passive participle forms that have been associated with -h?thornan finds that they are consistent with the hypothesis of a strong class III hthornan: the corrupt aeohed in the Erfurt Glossary and hyode in the Old English Bede are more plausibly ascribed to the family of ?thornan to devastate', while ahudan in Genesis A 2007 represents a strong rather than a weak preterite plural form.",54,"WOS:000422626100004",3

These are usually very simple, probably as simple as they come, and not much of a contribution to the history of clothes and costumes in Scandinavia when it comes to design, textiles, and handiwork. On the other hand, they can tell us something about the Icelandic medieval community and people's ideas about remote and unknown nations, specifically as regards notions about civilization and the superiority of certain communities. Accordingly, the article will focus on the symbolic nature of the clothes by taking a closer look at the trolls themselves, their community and social status as described in the literature.

The Popular Indignant March had been conceived as an original way of rounding off the occupations of hundreds of squares throughout Spain, their objective being Puerta del Sol in Madrid, the first square to be occupied. On the way, which was from the urban periphery toward the center, passing by the rural Spanish plateau, the population's claims and complaints were to be gathered and taken to the agora of the participatory democracy. The experience of having groups of people walking from different origins with a common destination evokes the classical anthropological experience of the religious pilgrimage. Spain's best example is the Camino de Santiago, which has attracted thousands of pilgrims from all over Europe since the Middle Ages. When we ask Guillermo about this parallelism, he denies any spiritual content, although his account of Camino de Sol is like the fulfillment of a civic promise, the ritualization of a festive and revindicative appropriation of the territory, the colonization of a terra incognita that they had taken over two months before, on 15M, when the hashtag #spanishrevolution became a trending topic within the social networks.

Arguing for John Wilson's theorisation of 'national character' as a crucial determinant of Blackwood's representative position, this article analyses the manner in which Maga responded to Irish literature and society in a transperipheral manner, seeking to integrate Ireland more fully into the Union, and to accept its destiny as a partner in Britain's imperial enterprise. Ireland's failure, through its poets (such as Thomas Moore) and its people, to conform to this ideal, and its headstrong movement towards Catholic Emancipation under the leadership of Daniel O'Connell, would generate the choleric position that came to characterize the magazine.",16,"WOS:000412887900009",3

"English","Dream; Alexander; Nightmare; Premonitory; Vision; Fear",,"One interpretation of dreams is that they are the catalyst of what the imagination produces, the source of the marvels and myth in literary and artistic creation. With this in mind, it is worthwhile to examine some of the earliest literary depictions of the supernatural, and those fantastic elements whose origins are more firmly rooted in the imagination than in the observable world. The twelfth-century literary blossoming in the langue d'o < l region produced notable examples of such works, with the Alexander the Great saga among those works that were the most widely reproduced. Indeed, the Macedonian conqueror became a source of fascination for medieval clerics, his imagined deeds serving both as a model of conduct as well as a moralizing lesson on the dangers of unbridled ambition. The Roman's unusual treatment of Alexander is striking, and the text itself is a blend of portrait, detailed travel narrative, and chanson de geste. More importantly however, the juxtaposition within the text of realistic imagery and odd, inexplicable dreamscape creates a text that mirrors the human consciousness upon awakening, trapped between the fleeting realm of night and the solid world of the senses. The goal of this study will be to show how certain passages of Alexandre de Paris's Roman d'Alexandre mirror a dream narrative. If Alexander's dream before adventuring east is premonitory as his dream interpreters indicate, then how should one read the adventures that follow?.",10,"WOS:000392292700001",3
"English",,,"One notion of African identity is based on the credo that generally champions the view that so-called Africans should not only celebrate an identity that is predicated on racialised and essentialised blackness, but also seek out (and hopefully render assistance to) any black persons anywhere in the world. Crucially, it was the black experience of slavery, as well as colonialism, that helped to foster such essentialised notions of identity. It is a matter of tragic irony that the very people who were written out of history are architects of some of the continent's worst excesses, notably ethnic wars, genocides and related manifestations of black-on-black hatred and violence. Rather than giving attention to ideological positions that privilege notions of predetermined ""Africanness"", I situate the debate in the disciplinary positions of history, philosophy and literature, and posit the idea of intermediality, meaning a state of in-betweenness, as a model for articulations of identity that not only promote the reality of our ""otherness"", but also teach us what it means to be human. I argue that the idea of an African identity that is grounded on an essentialised blackness flies in the face of the history of a continent that has always been defined by ""otherness"" or difference. In employing intermediality as a core concept of intersubjectivity on all articulations of identity that put the emphasis on respect for difference, I invoke selected post-structuralist and postmodern discourses to argue for an African identity in the twenty-first century that is more fluid and contested than any transcendent regimes of cultural certainty and legitimacy would have us believe.

By focusing on both the necessity of reform and the exigency of the historical sense in Hawthorne's works, this essay argues that the significance of his contribution to American literature is better understood if special emphasis is placed on how his political and historical concerns interact in his major novel. In The Scarlet Letter, Hester Prynne's return signifies a transformation from social rebel to conformist, which is designed to illustrate a revised and democratic relationship between self and community, although it fails to lead to full reconciliation between the two.

The question of ""am I saved?"" is thus closely allied with the question ""when will I know that I am saved?"" This article explores the tension between these two questions in Donne's Holy Sonnets, examining the Sonnets' temporal ambiguities in order to suggest that Donne uses this ambiguity as a strategy to recast the question of his salvation within a framework he controls. Through careful reading of Donne's use of shifting verb tenses and moods, this article shows how the Holy Sonnets struggle to develop a concrete narrative of salvation, a struggle consistent with Donne's widely noted distrust of time. Instead of tracing a linear temporal progression toward assurance, the Sonnets shift from the indicative and conditional to the imperative mood as a way to stop time and reframe the question of the speaker's salvation as a matter of possibility rather than of future promise. Instead of asking whether he is saved or when he will know whether he is saved, Donne's speaker refigures the problem around the question of whether he is able to be saved, using the poetic and grammatical tools at his disposal to produce the answer he wants.",22,"WOS:000405060300005",3

This article contends that by paying greater attention to the reception of Kierkegaard's writings in works of creative literature we can learn a significant amount about the interaction of aesthetic form and theological content within them. To demonstrate this, it conducts a close reading of seven poems about Kierkegaard by the twentieth-century Welsh poet and priest R. S. Thomas (1913-2000). Each of Thomas's poems situates the experience of writing and reading Kierkegaard's works on a sequence of spatial, psychological and literary peripheries. By doing this, they illustrate how those works decentre and destabilise the single individual reader aesthetically in a manner that correlates with the necessary decentring and destabilising of the individual self before God. They illustrate, too, a correspondence between the sensation of aesthetic collapse that accompanies the ultimate incommensurability of form and content in Kierkegaard's writings and the sensation of spiritual collapse that accompanies a recognition of the incommensurable paradox at the heart of Christian faith.",32,"WOS:000402024800004",3

"English","Wilde (Oscar); Salome; decadence; aesthetics; French",,"Oscar Wilde's Salome was an adventure in decadence, decapitation, and the French language. Wilde called the play his 'first venture to use for art that subtle instrument of music, the French tongue' (Hart-Davis 331). Its initial performance in England was prohibited and it was not produced on stage until 1896; even then, it opened in Paris and not London. However, Wilde would not be thwarted; he insisted on publication, anyway. In fact, 'outraged at this philistine censorship of his art, Wilde defiantly published his play in February 1893, bound in 'Tyrian purple' wrappers to go with Alfred Douglas' gilt hair' (Hoare 73). This endeavor, however, presented another set of problems. English-speaking readers could only gain an accurate comprehension of the text with an equally accurate translation of the original French. After two exhaustive attempts at translation, each by men who knew (and loved) him well, Wilde conceded, it appears, that these were the best possible while working within the constraints of Victorian censorship. Wilde's personal objections to the translations were not the only issue. In Victorian England the French language, after all, was as unacceptably decadent as the play. In fact, the aesthetic passion in the French language lends itself to the extremism of the play; Salome would not be Salome without it. Through writing in French and, 'In choosing to write his version of Salome in the form of a play, Wilde rather archly extends the dynamics of the aestheticizing gaze and its struggle for perceptual authority out beyond the canvas of his art' (Greger 50). The play's overall concern here is not entirely the notion of passion, but decadence-that is, that fine line between the depraved and the indulgent. Examples of this exist and spring from the multilingual literary environment of Western Europe during the period. Wine, women, beauty, and sex were the bases for the hedonistic lifestyle led by those within the afore-mentioned places and eras, and these are communicated in both voice-or timbre-and meaning. Wilde would add another significant element to this definition through his portrayal of decadence in Salome: death. Sex and death become symbolic of the ultimate self-indulgent acts as Salome lusts after Iokanaan's severed head. These actions alone might be enough to shock and inspire the masses, but Wilde had more in mind. For him, the only language poetic enough to support such excess was French. As it happened, it was also the only culture open enough to receive it on stage, as well. French decadence-the sensuous vocality, the varying connotations taken on in the polyglot literary environment during the period, and the bold outward presentations of said language on stage- rides on both voice and meaning as it interacts with the play's subject matter, and results in the most depraved and indulgent of productions. The overall issue continued to be translation; the struggles in translating the play in terms of language were mirrored in translating the highly indulgent subject matter-made more so by the original language-for the English stage.",20,"WOS:000422974900010",3

The focus is on the aesthetic impact of these relations more than on the question of genesis or influence. The basis for the interpretation will be the opposition between the period of the performance and the post-performance time, as well as the notion of liminality.

Recent literary criticism and theory, its sense of temporality and spatiality recalibrated, has sought an interpretive methodology for reading the planetary and the geological in literature. Of particular issue is scale and whether the humanist imaginaries of the literary are sufficiently multi-scalar to apprehend the unfolding Anthropocene. This essay argues that in the emphasis on scale, issues of mediation are overlooked. Turning to genre fiction, particularly that of Paulo Bacigalupi, this essay argues that its future scenarios of climate change, ecological collapse, and near-extinction - a more fully realised Anthropocene - stage cultural memories of the unfolding aetiologies of the conditions imagined in the future but often subject to dissociation in our present. Conceptualising this fiction as the work of speculative memory, this essay finds in such acts of recall a self-reflexiveness as to the mediations of environmental remembrance. That is, in this futural work of cultural memory, the localisation of the planetary particularises the Anthropocene and foregrounds the ways that it is framed.",28,"WOS:000403784300003",3

The following investigates this tendency to fall back on Pitaval's body of cases by comparing and contrasting two of the later, and most important, German collections of. causes celebres : the Merkwurdige Rechtsfalle (1792-5) and Der neue Pitaval (1842-90). First, this article analyses these collections from a macro perspective, reading them as anthologies: selective compilations of 'causes celebres' which promote a canon that is representative of the topic of the collection, and which include cases in order to support an overarching concept and popularise political Enlightenment knowledge. Although the Merkwurdige Rechtsfalle and Der neue Pitaval make a similar selection of 'causes celebres', the contexts of the anthologies give them very different meanings. The second part of this paper illustrates this point by examining the differing conceptions of the female poisoner ('Giftmischerin') in the two collections. It demonstrates the contrast between the creation of stereotypes in the Merkwurdige Rechtsfalle and a differentiated typology in Der neue Pitaval. Rather than defining the criminal from a legal point of view by a number of universalised and reductive insights regarding the offence, the nineteenth-century. 'causes celebres' adopt a disciplinary perspective.

Instead, we might categorize these records as themselves ritualistic. The term ritual observance gestures to the act of observing a ritual, but also the way in which the observation is itself ritualistic.

The male protagonist, a nameless editor, has to rely on the women's willingness to let him in on their secret, allow him access to the letters of the dead poet Jeffrey Aspern, which he assumes to be in their possession, and, hence, let him face his own unspeakable secret in a ` closet' that is not his own.",20,"WOS:000399284200003",3

This essay considers the construction of the neo-Victorian canon, and contends that its formation follows the same trajectory as that of the broader literary canon in the early twentieth century, initially excluding or marginalizing particular works (in particular, popular fiction and culture) prior to expanding to include a wider array of texts and genres, including, in recent years, global literatures. I map the development of the neo-Victorian canon to date, including critical debates around the genre, and examine the implications of this in terms of prevailing attitudes towards literary and cultural scholarship, popular culture, and textual colonization, before considering the (sometimes problematic) usage and connotations of the terminology associated with this key genre of contemporary fiction.

Radcliffe's novel veils the possibility of a masturbatory narrative with music and instrumentality. The lute, an instrument with diverse and erotic resonances in the eighteenth century, mediates these practices for Radcliffe's two heroines. In meditating on the lute's depiction, I trace the early modern history of the lute in literature and art, reflect on its connections to embodiment and erotic performance, and consider the ways musical performance becomes a site of female intimacy and pleasure, which complicates readings of public and private spaces.

To Shklovsky's esthetic salvation through estranged perception, Brecht adds value criteria from salvational politics, using, for example, in The Caucasian Chalk Circle a Marxist figuralism, which rationalizes the sensual body. However, estrangement as a formal device which doubts the present norms is ideologico- politically ambiguous: in the Brecht or Marxist wing it is 'critical,' but in other hands it may be 'mythical': Hamsun, Junger, Pound, and the Iranian Ta'ziyeh play use it with a lay or religious proto- fascist horizon. The final section follows Timpanaro's insistence on biological death as not fully reducible to politics in the usual sense, and juxtaposes stumbling, death, and creative eros as politics.

Reading the novel against Capuana's intense critical engagement with D'Annunzio's fiction from Il piacere (1889) to Il fuoco (1900), and charting the presence of several significant Dannunzian hypotexts, it concludes that while Capuana clearly debunks superomismo, he does not definitively reject D'Annunzio's ideal of art-in-life.",34,"WOS:000405077300007",3

In my analysis of the author's 2002 novel, The Book of Illusions, I show how Auster subverts the postmodern paradigm of deconstructing the humanist subject as a locus of ethical conflicts and choices. A meditation on assuming responsibility for one's own actions and their sometimes tragic consequences, the novel rejects any claim to an unsatisfying relativism of anything goes. In a story obsessively occupied with guilt and penance, characters are held accountable for their mistakes and neglects. Shaped by chance events, unanticipated encounters, and deadly accidents, The Book of Illusions confirms Auster's view of the random workings of the universe.

The novel deploys two thematic and narrative trajectories in which the first factors in the three pairs jointly trend toward hope and the second toward its loss. The conclusion of Judgment Day leaves unclear which one, if either, will prevail, but the novel clearly favors humaneness as the appropriate response to the ""conflicts and ambiguities"" of being a conscious and overly -sensitive species. The community's attempt via a historical pageant to raise money to restore its medieval church becomes central stage for the playing out of the foregoing dynamics, which the church's ancient wall painting of The Last Judgment encapsulates.

McTaggart; it ended the decade deracinated into the pluralistic atomism espoused by Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore. If this intellectual sea change can be conceived as analytic and logical philosophies inventing their wheel, then T.S. Eliot re-invented it as a student of Russell's in the 1910s, when he, too, turned to atomism after growing dissatisfied with Bradley's absolute. But by 1915, Eliot had grown as disenchanted with atomism as he had with absolutism and ultimately charted a course between the two, which he called ""relativism."" Relativism shines through in Eliot's rejuvenated dedication after 1915 to principles of ""organization"" that attempt to put an atomized world back together without returning to the unsystematic mysticism of Bradley's original absolute. This attempt - its successes and failures - manifests in the Sweeney poems as a play between formal chaos and order, with poetry itself suspended between these two tendencies.",33,"WOS:000416779700006",3

Around the same time, however, the portrait gallery emerged as a significant literary motif and began to proliferate in Gothic fiction, satirical tales, fin de siecle novels, and other fiction. This migration of the gallery into the realm of literature represents an important revaluation of the cultural capital associated with this art form and calls attention to the troubled cultural protocols and visualities of an age which saw the rise of a rival institution, viz., the public museum. The purpose of this article is to trace the history of the motif of the portrait gallery from its beginnings in Horace Walpole, Walter Scott, and other Gothic authors over the fin de siecle generation of J.-K. Huysmans, Oscar Wilde, Marcel Schwob, and R. M. Rilke to modern adaptations by James Joyce, Hermann Hesse, Salman Rushdie, Giovanni de Lampedusa, and others.

"English",,,"Pierre Corneille's tragicomedy Le Cid has often been interpreted as the story of medieval Castile's transition from feudalism to a strong monarchy, a story that clearly resonates with France's own domestic political concerns under Louis XIII. This article focuses instead on Castile's external political engagements in the play, and how they reflect France's efforts to establish colonies during the seventeenth century. It is argued here that reading Le Cid alongside France's record of colonization in North America allows the play to be understood not only as an exploration of a fraught moment in French domestic politics, but also as a reflection of the kingdom's efforts to maintain and expand control over foreign lands. Several aspects of Le Cid - Rodrigue's duel with Don Gomes and the events surrounding it, Castile's conflict with the Moors, and King Don Fernand's mostly ineffective efforts to maintain order - appear on close inspection to have implications for affairs external as much as internal, a feature of Corneille's tragicomedy that distinguishes it from the Spanish play that inspired it. More broadly, this article shows how accounting for France's colonization of the New World may help cast the famously insular French seventeenth century in a new and revealing light.",33,"WOS:000397104300001",3

He exists on the fringes of significant political manoeuvrings in the sagas, and is referenced in several well-known sources. Although Porsteinn might be called a minor character in these sources, the tangible details of his life hint at more dramatic instances in his story and the Icelandic annals record the fact that he was killed in 1027. The circumstances of Porsteinn's death are not preserved in any of the sagas in which he participates, although Grettis saga mentions it in passing, and references to it may be discerned in Laxdcela saga and Eyrlyggja saga. In this article, the portrayal of Porsteinn in three scenes found in Laxdcela saga and Grettis saga is re-evaluated. His characterisation is consistent across the sagas, and his narrative role is largely connected to the portrayal of his more significant relatives. It has previously been suggested that Porsteinn was the subject of a lost saga; Judith Jesch, however, has argued that Porsteinn's appearances were more likely due to authorial ""imagination"" than to the existence of an earlier, written saga. Here, the portrayal of Porsteinn is returned to in light of an understanding of the role of oral tradition and immanence in saga narrative. Thus, details of Porsteinn's position in the narratives of Laxdcela saga and Grettis saga are examined, and apparently irrelevant information in each saga is examined side by side in order to demonstrate the evidence for a coherent reading of Porsteinn Kuggason's life, and his death.",42,"WOS:000419085500002",3

By therefore considering adaptability as process and condition of all biological and intercultural renewal - importantly to include 'big' science and data - attention can turn in three interconnecting subsections to the 'stuff' of adaptability in its key dynamics: resilience, revitalization and recovery. By deliberately choosing natural science examples to illustrate each section, the article conducts a thought experiment in how Romance Studies research might fruitfully remind twenty-first-century sciences and information technologies of their intercultural roots, and that theirs are not superior, or distinctive, intellectual domains. The article then clarifies not only a co-equal place for Humanities' insights, but also how these are already equipped to ascertain features of optimal adaptability for the greater potential enrichments of cultural and empirical research.",46,"WOS:000423439300002",3
"English","Luigi Pirandello; theatre; meta-theatre; drama; performance; staging; authorship; appropriation; adaptation; translation; modernization",,"Re-narrations, re-interpretations and adaptations of inherited texts and stories are crucial mechanisms through which human beings receive and create meaning. Theatre is particularly interesting in this sense, as it is an art form that inherently implies collective creation through the involvement of at the very least one performer and one spectator. The staging of a play exemplifies and makes apparent the more general truth that any encounter with a text, in the broadest sense of the word, is in fact an act of appropriation. Pirandello's plays constitute a highly relevant instance, because it has been argued that the meta-theatrical discourse of his 'teatro nel teatro' trilogy is inevitably out of date because of its inherent historical relativity. Successful productions of Pirandello's plays, therefore, need to include reflections on their meta-theatrical discourse and to appropriate such discourse so that it is meaningful to a new linguistic, historical, geographical and cultural context; in other words, Pirandello's plays intrinsically need to be adapted. This paper reflects on the problematic adaptive thrust of Pirandello's theatre through the case study of a specific production of Questa sera si recita a soggetto in English under its English title of Tonight We Improvise staged in Providence (RI, USA) in Spring 2014.",18,"WOS:000423439300005",3
"English",,"'BEOWULF'; FEAST","Readers have long recognized that the sleep of Beowulf's men as they await Grendel's arrival in Heorot is a peculiar incongruity in this scene. Early scholars attributed this oddity to an undigested element of the underlying folktale; literary critics focused on the structure and aesthetics of the scene have simply accepted this sleep, while some recent oral-formulaic studies have attributed it to the imperatives of an oral-derived theme. Yet no one has realized that two aspects of Grendel's approach are equally incongruous: his intention to ensnare someone in this hall which has been empty for twelve years, and his purposeless rage as he pushes open the door. When we compare this scene to the brief account of Grendel's first attack, it becomes apparent that the poet has withheld many of the details which belong to this initial attack, delaying their occurrence until his final approach to the hall, when they are dramatically much more effective. This postponement, with its disregard for narrative logic, provides suspense and uncertainty for a combat scene which would otherwise be entirely predictable, and it reveals the inner horror and vacuity of Grendel's existence.",37,"WOS:000411226000001",3

But what brandura meant and how favorably it was viewed depended on context. Brandura was associated with the middle style, with mastery of elocutio, and, by extension, with poetry's ability to move those who listened to or read it. Therefore it could at one moment provoke moral anxiety and at another signal the height of poetic accomplishment. In quarrels over the relative merits of the European vernaculars, apologists for the Portuguese language invested in Bernardes's reputation as brando (gentle), as he was said to demonstrate the brandura of their mother tongue. Yet later in the seventeenth century his fortunes sank. Though he is little esteemed today, his association with the multiple meanings of brando and brandura implicated him in important political, moral, and aesthetic disputes throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By paying renewed attention to style and affect in the context of cultural history, this essay aims to revive interest in Bernardes's work.",71,"WOS:000414769500002",3

That profane mode of thought later finds more enthusiastic expression in the early English novels of Daniel Defoe and others, but it begins to take shape in Milton, who derives it from none other than religious sources such as scripture, atonement theology, and nostalgia for purgatory.

My touchstone will be Rodrigo Fresan, particularly his novel Jardines de Kensington, a text that theorizes writing literature and views it as an inclusive physical and geographical territory. In a world where national and cultural boundaries are blurred, where migration is a norm, and where the ideal of the nation-state seems to be incapable of articulating one's belonging, Fresan proposes to consider literature as a space that could be called home, challenging the tradition of authorial rights and property and suggesting that literature be viewed as a territory constructed entirely through collaboration.",20,"WOS:000401519300002",3

It argues that the Legend is not an outlier in the canon of Chaucer's poetry, but closely related to Anelida and Arcite as well as Troilus and Criseyde. It reads the supposed awkwardness of the language and the compressed, seemingly rushed portions in several narratives as reflections of Chaucer's larger project to transform exemplary narratives purportedly about women's fidelity in love into stories examining a wider variety of social interactions that contribute to or undermine the creation of social harmony, stories in which women's desires and choices are often central.",18,"WOS:000395512900003",3

Though oil had always been crucial to the globalization of the zombie via the film industry, an overt preoccupation with oil only belatedly seeped into zombie aesthetics, just a few years before the global oil crisis of 1973. Marking a clear shift in zombie aesthetics, George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968) transformed the zombie-labourer into the human flesh-consuming petro-zombie horde.

"English","Edith Wharton; War literature; Travel writing; French culture; Architecture; Historical continuity; Aesthetic theory; Visualization of war; Language of war","WORLD-WAR; ARCHITECTURE","Reading Wharton's two nonfiction texts about France together provides the possibility of comparing a pre-war travelogue to a war report on French culture. Wharton's precise descriptions and sound method of visual interpretation of moral value in A motor-flight (1908) become problematized in descriptions of war damage in Fighting France (1915). A motor-flight provides several examples of continuity in French material culture offering the chance of a meaningful use of the past. In Fighting France, visits to the war zone show the damage done to civilized landscapes, historical monuments, houses, cathedrals that are destroyed or ruined, offering only chances to think of the scope of the losses in cultural terms, meditations on the lost sense of the past. Images of destruction are linked to this loss of historical continuity. Visits to the trenches show the war as a menace difficult to visualize for the traveller. Here the main effect of the war seems to be the continual threat to secure reflexes and habits of the old reality that is being replaced by war. Also, there are no reports on human wounds but descriptions of the damage to the material environment become humanized. In general, however great the material damage shown and the cultural ruin indicated, Wharton finds traces of continuity in the devastated French countryside of the abandoned war zone: new life begins in the ordered lines of the gardens, in the new uses of the churches, in the reorganization of everyday life among the ruins. From the perspective of the language of war, this means that Wharton's war reports do not use the disillusioned tone necessary for the language of Anglo-Saxon male combat gnosticism. The standard reason for this can be that she was never in combat. Another likely reason, however, can be her Francophilia. In a gesture that may be identified as a reliance on the outmoded British high rhetoric of war, Wharton adopts the French attitude to historical continuity she describes, which eventually cannot and would not accept the material and cultural devastation the war brings. Although a non-combatant who is rarely close to the lines, Wharton does not report on the home front and her new roles there. She struggles to comprehend and represent her experience of the war zone as an eyewitness, and the method she uses for this is the architectural vision of her former travelogue in order to communicate the extent of the material loss to her noncombatant American audience.",36,"WOS:000414980500018",3

Here the authors review experimental literature based on the notion that semantic memory can be conceptualized in a manner similar to Euclidean space, and that properties of this space provide boundary conditions that invite uni- or bidirectionality when concepts are juxtaposed as in metaphor. The authors review three basic components of this space: distance of concepts A and B, varieties of distances (namely, those unique to the concepts themselves and those that are descriptive of higher-order relations), the density of space in which A and B reside, and the nature of such space for concrete and abstract concepts. The authors argue further that metaphor comprehension involves both use of these factors and pragmatic knowledge and that, unfortunately, in the typical psychology experiments, metaphors are presented for processing in impoverished pragmatic conditions. Under these conditions, the main pragmatic knowledge available for use is knowledge available in semantic space (e.g., distance, feature types, concreteness, and density). The authors review and report studies that demonstrate that the information available in semantic space can invite bidirectionality or topic vehicle asymmetry, and that bidirectionality can be more easily obtained when the metaphors are placed in a discourse context.

"English","Charles Dickens; David Copperfield; authorship; unproductiveness; labor",,"Recent criticism of Charles Dickens's David Copperfield (1849-50) has often drawn attention to the eponymous character's rise to respectable and productive professional authorship. This essay, however, considers the fact that one of David's most formative experiences, the flight from London to Dover that removes him from the blacking warehouse and sets him on the path to a middle-class life, casts him as an instance of the most disrespectable, unproductive member of Victorian society: the vagrant who chooses not to work. As invested, then, as David Copperfield is in promoting traditional Victorian values such as earnestness and industriousness, it is equally committed to recuperating the value of unproductive acts in an industrial society. Yet, as the novel itself is evidence of Dickens's abundant productivity, it clearly cannot do so without complications. From the complexities inherent in Dickens's competing fascinations with participating in and escaping from the economic sphere, this essay argues, a picture emerges of the imaginative tools that Dickens uses to conceptualize literary value and provide solutions for his vexed relationship to the market. In David Copperfield, Dickens uses David's vagrancy and mediating effects as narrator to suggest that even though his own novel is produced for the market, it is not defined by the market's logic.",24,"WOS:000411777000003",3

This appeal aligns with the appeal of today's ""down-low"" in that it plays at the borderlines of masculinity, knowingness, and innocence. Hughes's closet is racialized; his refusals challenge presumptions about sexual identities as race-free categories. Desire in his poetry challenges us to rethink sexuality and sexual categories today. But those whose sexual identity is in development already do that rethinking; Hughes offers ways to ask questions about one's sexuality without classificatory answers, a lesson to take into classrooms where Hughes is already being taught and sexual identity is in development.",54,"WOS:000392040100002",3

The impossibility of salvaging the past against the often stifling imperatives of the present that she accounts for in her essay 'We Refugees' is, however, also what produces affective economies in the diasporic subject that I argue are crucial to diasporic identity formation.

In order to determine and further develop the significance of shame for diasporic subject formation, this essay will consider its impact on subjectivity in a comparative close reading of two contemporary novels, V.

"English","Caryl Phillips; black womanhood; womanism; pro-woman(ist); black intimacy","IDEOLOGY","Representations of black women in literature by black men received much critical attention in the latter part of the twentieth century. Frances Smith Foster argues that ""black men shared the nineteenth century predilection for defining women . . . and for limiting the female protagonist. ""Trudier Harris' book Black Women in the Fiction of James Baldwin examined the literature of the twentieth century's most impactful African American male writer and his persistent portrayal of black women as morally constrained. More recently, Curdella Forbes' From Nation to Diaspora: Sam Selvon, George Lamming and the Cultural Peformance of Gender explored several depictions of women in Afro-Caribbean literature. Yet this area of study has not been exhausted, and it seems necessary to pursue it with regard to Caryl Phillips, one of the most prolific writers in the African diaspora today. Phillips' work has already garnered attention for its ability to authentically represent women's voices. His novels Cambridge and The Nature of Blood in particular have been highly praised for their female narrators, and Phillips has discussed the case with which he engages women's voices. This essay aims to advance the study of Phillips' unique and varied portrayal of women by analyzing his depiction of black women in Dancing in the Dark, The Nature of Blood,and The Final Passage. The article explores how women in the world of Phillips' texts navigate the physical and emotional spaces of intimacy in which their voices and experiences initially seem to be occluded by men's stories. I argue that Phillips offers nuanced depictions of black women which bend, break, and at times reify so as to critique well-established and often controversial literary archetypes of blackness, revealing that his fiction works in what Gary L. Lemons describes as a pro-woman(ist) mode.",50,"WOS:000415665400005",3
"English",,"SCIENCE-FICTION; OCTAVIA","Responding to Octavia E. Butler's notes and early drafts of Fledgling, located in the Huntington Library, I argue that Butler employs themes of symbiosis in Fledgling to disrupt views of the nature/culture divide. Butler depicts two key examples of symbiosis in Fledgling: the symbiosis of the Ina/symbiont relationship and the symbiosis of DNA within Shori as a genetically modified individual. The results of these two types of symbiosis are polar opposites; while the Ina/symbiont relationship is often strained, the symbiosis of genes in Shori work together perfectly to make her a powerful transgenic organism. This difference suggests that it is the cultural aspect of symbiosis that is problematic-while nature is inherently symbiotic, the cultural aspects of the Ina/symbiont relationship (sexual relations, power struggles, racism, speciesism) make it more difficult for Inas and symbionts to engage in mutualistic symbiosis.",32,"WOS:000414380500004",3
"English","Dada; ethics; modernism; avant-garde; poetry",,"Responding to the total devastation and global upheavals of the world's first industrial war, avant-garde poets in the first decades of the twentieth century undertook the extraordinary task of developing a reality-shattering' aesthetic and dismantling the verisimilitudes of realism in a momentous turn to toward the ethical'. Both multivalent, trans-modal, and often contradictory, these experimental and cross-genre innovations and poetic themes emerged in a new, trans-national Dada. Contributing to the burgeoning critical concern of the last decade in studies of twentieth century modernist poetry with the working through of ethics, this paper develops a case study for the textual ethics of Dada. The poems of the controversial first American Dada', Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, it is argued, are a preeminent example of an ethical experimentation in Dada, for her poetry in its material and transmodal aesthetic takes as its subject the trauma of being, and performs the dialogic dimensions of inter-human relations. The analysis reveals that while it is resistant to the possibilities of a collective moral code, Dada poesis can profoundly attest to the ethical tension of language troubling humanity in a vital process of historical transformation. By examining three areas of art poesis - ethics and trauma, ethics of the textual body, ethics and desire - the essay advances the first textual ethics of Dada.",53,"WOS:000390995300006",3

In Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained the phrase much revolving becomes iconic of revolution as period-defining movement. Milton's characters pivot, roll, twist, contort, resist, and return. In doing so, they show, and not simply describe, the lived experience of periodizing change.

We revise three commonplaces of theory to support discussions that follow from understanding rhetoric's ontology as an emergent, materially diverse phenomenon, shifting the emphasis from agency to capacity, from violence to vulnerability, and from recalcitrance to resilience. The proposed commonplaces treat ecology as an orientation to patterns and relationships in the world, not as a science. The article is organized by these three interrelated transitions. The first transition defines capacity more fully in contrast to symbol use as human agency. The second moves from thinking of rhetorical force as imposition, which is tied to violence, to understanding it as a distributed sense of capacity derived from mutual vulnerabilities between entities. The third suggests that the persistence of rhetorical capacities stems from systemic adaptability and sustainability (resilience) rather than individuated abilities to resist (recalcitrance).",79,"WOS:000397005800003",3
"English","adaptation; repetition; foregrounding; neurocognitive poetics; empirical aesthetics",,"Rhetorical effects in speech and writing have a great strategic importance in achieving the communicative end of being persuasive: they are key in the exertion of power through language. Persuasion occurs by cognitive-affective stimulation, relying on specific psychosomatic perceptual patterns which are used on all levels of speech reception in cultural and political contexts. This makes rhetorically conspicuous texts efficient as stimulus material for empirical research into neurocognitive modeling of how poetic texts are read. Adaptations as revisitations of prior works share with the rhetorical repertoire of repetition similar cognitive-affective properties, because both function via recognition of sameness or similarity. Recent paradigm shifts in adaptation studies have much enlarged the field of research, so Linda Hutcheon's as yet empirically unsupported insight that adaptation is the norm and not the exception in human imagination finds an unexpectedly large field of application. This shift away from the narrow standard paradigm of novels adapted for the screen to a more fundamental aesthetics of adaptation has also helped establish connections between adaptation studies and the experiment-based methodologies of empirical aesthetics and neuroaesthetics with a view to developing cognitive and affective models of the processes underlying the reception of adaptations.",70,"WOS:000403740400009",3

This essay traces Burns 'on the wallaby', as his work travels with - and is in turn transformed and re-written by - wandering labour movement writers.

In New Zealand, it has an extensive history of performance, in verse and song, from the earliest colonial period through to the aftermath of the First World War. An investigation into the poem's reception in early colonial New Zealand reveals the works of Burns to be not just 'a symphony and a synthesis of Scottish song and nationality', as some contemporary commentators suggested, but the foundation upon which a new, transcultural Scots-New Zealand cultural identity could be established. This essay uses nineteenth- and early twentieth-century New Zealand newspapers to map the ways in which 'Thou Ling'ring Star' was used by emigrant Scottish communities.

The novel's reception among economists from David Ricardo to Karl Marx was largely determined by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's revisionary reading, which excluded large parts of the narrative from consideration. In revisiting the parts that Rousseau thought extraneous, this essay finds that the character of Crusoe is an eminently social being who relies on the charity of several generous benefactors. Their relationships are notably amicable, constituted by mutual trust and goodwill. As an intimate society, they share gifts and ex change favours without apparent regard for profit-making. In representing them selves as generous friends, they belie the economic realities that support their accumulation of wealth.

Hence why other interesting related phenomena which are very significant in relation to the attitude adopted by the translator towards the syntax of the Latin text still remain almost neglected.

The present study, based on a corpus of nine different 16th-century Romance translations - Spanish, Italian, French - of Erasmus's dialogue Uxor mempsigamos, aims to verify the extent to which Latinate syntactic strategies are actually common in the translations under analysis as well as to check whether the reason for such strategies stems from the source text itself or they occur regardless of the latter.",96,"WOS:000414903500003",3

Mythical allusion, unexpected humour, dream dialogue contribute to the embrace of the inexplicable. The texture of the poems argues that Keats's engagement with family history is a recognition that the milieus he creates have an afterlife, that the recovery of an imagined past is not limiting but has currency for his own time future generations.

Although there is no direct influence there are many parallels between Beckett's stance towards astrology in Murphy and Theodor Adorno's The Stars Down to Earth (written 1952-3). It was likely Beckett's encounter with the work of Tommaso Campanella that led to the use of astrology as a plot device.

"English",,"'SUGAR-CANE'","Scholarship on James Grainger's perceived alliance with the West Indian plantocracy in The Sugar-Cane has so far not assimilated relevant information from the poem's extant manuscript. In an unpublished comment on Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, Grainger rejects Smith's characterization of planters as 'sordid masters' and plans his 'vindication' of planters accordingly. The published poem largely fulfils this plan: it argues that planters are not heritably incapable of moral sentiment, even as it accepts the Enlightenment's institutional critique of slavery as a political system that cultivates bad moral habits in slave masters. Grainger relies on conjectural-historical reasoning then typical of Enlightenment moral philosophy, and he posits 'probity' as a bulwark against Creole degeneration. Manuscript evidence suggests further that Grainger sought probity in his own philosophical outlook. Although modern scholars have sometimes seen the poem as an attempt to win plantocratic favour, political references confirm that he took a position in the Canada-Guadeloupe controversy opposed to that of the powerful West India Interest. Moreover, during the course of composition, Grainger altered his portraits of planters to make them less flattering and more satirical-an editing process consistent with his apparent desire for philosophical impartiality.",42,"WOS:000411226000005",3

One such approach, criticized by McKee in Story, is writing dialogue in search of a story.

"English","How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia; Mohsin Hamid; neoliberalism; novel; self-help",,"Self-help books sell the myth of self-determinism, empowerment and the eternal hope of reinvention, reasons no doubt for their enormous popularity. In this article, I examine Pakistaniborn Mohsin Hamid's latest novel, How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia (2013) which, with its catchy, hyperbolic title signalling its masquerade as a self-help book, openly and ironically advertises itself as a satire. The object of the novel's satire is the capitalist, neoliberal notion of the self that is predicated on an overweening sense of control and complete agency. Neoliberal subjectivity endorses the care and transformation of the self in order to take best advantage of a market economy, since the means to achieving material affluence is seen simply as a matter of individual choice and personal will. In the novel, Hamid brings into productive tension the conventions and assumptions of the self-help genre with those of the more traditional realist novel in order to interrogate not just the neoliberal self but the very ways in which the self is narrated and constructed. Engaging in particular with the affordances of technology in his novel as a thematic, Hamid appropriates the vantage points and perspectival positions made possible by modern technology to undermine the solipsistic self of the self-help book. He further exploits the narrative energies of the novel form to foreground a sense of historical contingency to lay bare various modes of self-constitution and self-narration. Through his use of metatextual narrative strategies, Hamid raises fundamental questions about the genre of the novel itself and the ways in which it is intimately invested in the insinuation of the development of a self. These questions, I argue, ultimately underline his affirmation of the novel's important place and the ethical role it can play at this contemporary moment of late and global capitalism.",21,"WOS:000397221300010",3

This understanding continues in later versions of the abbreviated psalter, which appear in Books of Hours as tools to be used for individual penance and intercessory prayer. The Harrowing of Hell, which follows the abbreviated psalter in the manuscript, enacts psalm-singing as a form of penance that is able to release souls from hell, demonstrating the efficacy of the Psalms in penitential and intercessory prayer. Likewise, Aedeluald's psalter selects verses that emphasise the role of the Psalter as a weapon against temptation and an instrument of salvation, with a particular focus on deliverance and protection from enemies. While it is unclear exactly how Aedeluald or subsequent redactors intended the abbreviated psalter to be used, this paper shows how the psalter harmonises with the Lenten, penitential emphasis in the Book of Cerne.",35,"WOS:000388724000002",3

While the connection between Morris and Jones has been noted, Jones's allusions to Morris have yet to be mined to elucidate his portrayal of social structures in In Parenthesis. D'Souza argues that reading In Parenthesis and A Dream of John Ball together reveals that Morris's work anticipates the social and communal preoccupations of In Parenthesis. In Jones's portrayal of the soldiers' communal living one glimpses many of Morris's socialist values, but they are imbued with a sense of the unifying power of sacramental action, as the Catholic Mass stands as the model for ideal community.",19,"WOS:000445976300011",3

Venus and Adonis responds to the attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth of Wit (1592), which contradictorily represents Shakespeare as both appropriative upstart and recognisable master of a distinct style. The figure of Richard III reflects Shakespeare's subsequent and aggressive rejection of the consanguinuity of shared labour in favour of a strongly willed authorial self-definition. However, this lonely ideal is ultimately untenable for a dramatist of the professional theatre, as is recognised in the figure of Autolycus in The Winter's Tale.

Hence his spectacular victory at Agincourt has been ascribed both to inspiring epic leadership and to the cold calculation of a ruthless political elite. In contrast, my article seeks to show that this reductive polarity has obscured the fact that Henry's French war signals the emergence of a new post-chivalric culture of violence defined by what has been termed the ""intellectualization of warfare."" I argue that the play's going-to-war rhetoric is characterized by an obsessive concern with polluting miscegenation rooted in the principles of dynastic honor: national defeat is imagined as a rape of the land that will be newly populated with bastards. Shakespeare, however, makes us feel that this honor-based view of the war belongs to the past whereas the king's post-feudal rule poses new dangers to human integrity. Thus, Henry the courtly lover, like Henry the scourge of Harfleur, cannot distinguish between essential identity and assumed role for, in his theatre of war, the martial hero has become simultaneously an enactor and spectator of the self, a paradox before which the traditional ethics of chivalry must collapse.",54,"WOS:000406086500004",3
"English",,,"Shakespeare's The Tempest presents the spectacle of a magician-prince who manipulates inhuman powers to regain his usurped dukedom and secure a marriage for his daughter that promises to make his descendants kings. The fantasy elements of the story, the play's incisive interrogation of political power, and its seemingly scandalous (to modern audiences) representations of colonial and patriarchal power have attracted a good deal of interest from readers and scholars in recent decades. However, most also recognize that the play is almost entirely devoid of plot or dramatic tension, in the usual sense. Because Prospero is so firmly in control of events on the island for nearly the entire play, there is little serious doubt that he will prevail in the end. Thus, if the play is to be taken on its own terms rather than refashioned into something that better fits current expectations, we must find the play's dramatic life somewhere other than in its action. I argue that that the dramatic heart of the play may be found in the fertile confluence of ethics, rhetoric, aesthetics, and metaphysics that shapes its reflection upon justice in a postlapsarian world. The climax is not a matter of exterior action, but a crisis of will and of ethical persuasion. What matters is not whether the wrathful Prospero will prevail over his enemies in the end, but whether he will prevail over himself Does the exertion of power inevitably turn humans into monsters? Within the play, this question hinges upon a breathless moment of persuasion which is best understood through the lens of Augustinian moral ontology.

Reading her 1996 novel, A Matter of Time, I argue that Deshpande explicitly rejects a modernist and postcolonial aesthetic in favour of a pedestrian and decidedly conventional realism. In so doing, Deshpande favours the social over the metaphysical as the location of meaning, reanimating realism as an internal communal process of social and cultural inquiry.

Going further, this article contends that Plato's influence was equally powerful in the realm of political theory, and that Shaw saw the Fabians as a species of philosopher kings, such as Plato outlines in The Republic.

One such case is the political and cultural relation between France and Vietnam, from the Indochinese colonization period to the Francophone Vietnamese Diaspora. It can be argued that the manner in which places are represented in Francophone graphic novels articulates Vietnamese colonial and post-colonial identities. Francophone graphic novels present how the issues of space and power are historically central to the ideology of colonialism. This article therefore analyzes two graphic novels, Maltaite and Lapiere's Le Carrefour de Nam-Pha (1987) and Truong and Leroi's Le Dragon de bambou (1991), and the promotion of imperialist power in the Francophone authors' depiction of colonial regions like Vietnam. These areas are portrayed as physically and psychologically dangerous, threatening to consume the white colonizer. In contrast, this article looks at ClementBaloup's Quitter Saigon: Memoires de Viet Kieu (2006) and suggests that his inventive graphic and textual practices create new spaces of belonging for transnational subjects. Baloup's emotionally provocative variations in traditional comic art style, which consist of a detailed focus on human bodies and landscapes, and sacrifice of visual realism, allow him to visually create what Homi Bhabha calls a third space, a space of new forms of cultural meaning and production that blurs the limitations of existing boundaries and calls into question established categorizations of culture and identity (34-35).

This article reads three Antwerp city poems alongside with biblical Psalm 137, in search for the poems' constructions of cities as homes. The selected texts each introduce the city (i.e., Antwerp for the Antwerp city poems; Jerusalem and Babylon for the psalm) and its possible identification with a home place in ways that are conceptually and stylistically similar. The poems only differ in their final portrayals of the home, themselves connected to the different context of each poem. Throughout the texts the poets explore and question the spatial categories of 'city' and 'home.' The analysis reveals that being at home both in biblical and Antwerp city poems is connected to childhood, which allows redefining the urban space. The poems conceive cities as a mobile category that is internalized if being defined as home space. Stylistic interventions, in particular the use of inclusios and contrast, help creating and establishing the city-as-home-space in the selected city poems.

Alongside this existed attempts to mediate between the force of the universal legal claim and the diversity of the world. Both G. W. F.

By retracing the comparative and multilingual encounters of modern Hebrew literature's Jewish, diasporic past, and reengaging these encounters via translation, Ho! advances a transnational model as the present and future of Israeli literature.",69,"WOS:000419357700006",3

This essay restores the import of race to the skyscraper by reading formalist theories by the father of modern architecture, Louis Sullivan, alongside a work of African American modernist fiction, Nella Larsen's Passing (1929). Reading Sullivan alongside Larsen explains how skyscrapers and blackness together have defined what gets seen as modern.

"English",,,"Since its publication in 1786, William Beckford's oriental tale Vathek has polarized readers. Written in the style of The Arabian Nights, Beckford's novella of the ninth caliph of Baghdad has been paradoxically defined as Eastern fable, Western fiction, autobiography, biography, and proto-ethnography. Likewise, stylistic assessments have cast Beckford's tale as satire, parody, pastiche, gothic, horror, and camp. This article attributes Vathek's striking polysemy to its visualizing orientalism, a graphic and graphical-manner of depiction not unlike the visual-textual language of comics. With its emphasis on setting, action, and gesture, Vathek reads like a classic action-adventure comic book. Moreover, Beckford's penchant for exaggeration and distortion steers Vathek into the domain of caricature and cartooning, an aesthetic that dominated the most popular European action-adventure comics, or bandes dessinees, of the mid-twentieth century. Drawing heavily on comics theory, this anachronistic and experimental re-evaluation of Vathek as a comic book uncovers the mechanics of Beckford's visualizing orientalism and gauges the effects of caricature and cartoons on its resonance and reception.",52,"WOS:000398800300004",3

By exploring Saro-Wiwa's negotiation of ideas of canon and history in his Biafran War writing, it argues that the civil war is a traumatic but transformative preoccupation of his literary and political work.

This article revisits one of Coetzee's novels in which these tensions come to the fore most explicitly, namely Age of Iron, to argue that it is precisely from the generative friction that arises between these two opposing fields that his writing draws its singularly affective force. I begin by considering the agonistic relationship between transcendent ideals and socio-material demands that marks Coetzee's account of the classic (""What is a Classic?: A Lecture""), describing it as a defining feature of his literary sensibility. The article then moves on to a reading of Age of Iron that focuses on the protagonist Mrs Curren's efforts, in the midst of the violent political struggle in apartheid South Africa, to speak in her own voice. My thoughts conclude with the suggestion that Coetzee's perennial staging of the conflict between a desire for autonomous expression and a socio-historical milieu that is indifferent to that desire can be read as an imaginative form of resistance, in the field of literary expression, to both the pressures of historical determinism and the dangers of postmodern insularity.",25,"WOS:000397221300006",3

Both rhetorical devices, grounded in acts of performance, reveal the gap between the nation's promises and its sobering reality. In such Native American 'performances,' the specter of the 'American Indian' that has so long haunted the white imagination is used to articulate and reveal the hidden power and omnipresence of Indian figures in the U.S. cultural imaginary. From early indigenous writers like William Apess to representatives of the Native American Renaissance, such as Sherman Alexie, mimicry and specularity are used as forms of resistance, empowering Native American speakers to find their voices in order to confront whites with their privileges and prejudices. If the notion of doing can be connected to the postcolonial concepts of mimicry and specularity, performativity emerges as the capacity to construct identity, to shape the voice of the subaltern, and to transform it into an instrument of power and resistance. Through the rhetorical means of appropriation and reflection, Apess transcends the discourse of colonization and effectively articulates a formerly subjugated voice. Alexie, on the other hand, offers us a mirror image of dominant prejudices, assumptions and fears regarding American Indians, putting the reader into the role of the subaltern.",54,"WOS:000404195700002",3

In response, a great deal of post-transitional South African literature and criticism has taken up the question of how to effect reconciliation, particularly outside institutional forums like the TRC. A prominent strand of South African literary studies insists that reconciliation rests on a form of ethical responsibility in which the individual is displaced from him-or herself in order to enact hospitality toward others. This view draws on a Levinasian conception of ethics whereby responsibility entails radical vulnerability with no assurance of reciprocation. Yet a growing corpus of fiction complicates this vision of reconciliation, recognizing that for many South Africans, the violations of apartheid gave rise to what Annie Coombes refers to as a ""dissolution of [the] self"", and any effort at building a more inclusive society must redress that dissolution. This article argues that Jo-Anne Richards' My Brother's Book (2008) and Achmat Dangor's Bitter Fruit (2001) present reconciliation as a product of two opposing endeavours. On the one hand, it involves the willingness to give up a sense of self in taking on responsibilities for others.

The possibility of multiple routes culminating in the underworld, and the necessity of guidance, form the bedrock of the interwoven analysis of the Inferno, Paradise Lost, Frankenstein, and Heart of Darkness. Amidst the profusion of pathways, the Inferno and Paradise Lost gesture towards a direction that is replicated and repudiated in Mary Shelley and Joseph Conrad's versions of the descent voyage in Frankenstein and Heart of Darkness. Dante and Milton's 'prototype' narratives exemplify the descent - or the fall - into hell, and shape the two novels through 'literary guidance'. Heart of Darkness emerges as an inversion of the meticulously structured Dantean universe. The Pilgrim's progress in the Inferno is a consistent counterpoint to Conradian chaos and Marlow's wilful yet meandering descent into colonial Africa. Dante's Pilgrim emerges from the underworld to progress onwards, while Marlow remains entrenched in the inescapably infernal condition of twentieth-century imperialism. The Inferno is an unacknowledged spectre that haunts the proceedings of the novella, but Milton's poetic re-telling of Genesis is a recognised presence in Frankenstein. Paradise Lost is re-viewed through the perspective of the hapless Monster, who oscillates between identifying with Satan and Adam. Both poets thus dabble in the attainment (or the elusiveness) of salvation, while the novelists struggle to salvage a semblance of significance with which they can imbue their characters' journeys. While 2016 saw several literary anniversaries, a strand that the organisers envisioned intertwining with 'salvaging', the year 2015 marked the 750th birth anniversary of Dante, sparking speculation about the present-day pertinence of the afterlife.

"English","Ecophobia; Biophilia; Genetic materialism; Material ecocriticism; Cultural biology","ECOPHOBIA","Some materials may have more agency than we might imagine or wish. This was the radical proposal of E.O. Wilson more than three decades ago in Biophilia (1984). Evolutionary biologists have long speculated about the genetic roots of both our affinity with and our acrimony to nature, and ecocritics have been quick to fix on biophilia as a tenet of environmental salvation. The obverse side has won less favor. But the cheerful picture of a world run by biophilic impulses is as fanciful and inaccurate as utopic visions of a world without anger or evil. Irrational fears of snakes and darkness, for starters, are evolution-based ecophobia at play. I will review in this article what sorts of attempts ecocritics have made to reconcile our material animality and genetic inheritance with the production of literature. Such work has been described by Judith Heerwagen and Gordon H. Orians as ""both futile and ideologically dangerous,"" and sometimes with good reason (which I will get into in detail in the article). One of the things that quickly becomes apparent is that without verifiable data, virtually every ecocritical reading or theory we do amounts to little more than what Richard Lewontin calls ""an exercise in plausible story telling rather than a science of testable hypotheses."" One of the ways to avoid this without becoming a mouthpiece for the sciences is to recognize that behavioral traits, though often shared, are contextual and individual, meaning that any kind of empirical or systemic analysis must also be case-by-case and not reducible to the kind of templates that are, perhaps, more pleasing to literary critics. Maybe we can plop deconstruction or new historicism down on any old text, but material ecocriticism of the sort I am proposing here is a much more painstaking endeavor. With a keen eye trained on the dangers of ""literary Darwinism"" (and all that it both entails and promises), I will argue that studying the genetic roots of ecophobia offers to explain (consonant with evolutionary psychology) how adaptive behaviors to a material world in which we no longer live function. This work is crucial if we are to understand how we got into our current environmental crisis, why we seem unable to get out of it, and why biophilic theorizing alone hasn't answered and never will answer these questions.",46,"WOS:000414980500003",3

This article addresses this question through an analysis of the motif of fruit in Phenomenology of Spirit. In the first part of the article I examine how scholars such as Slavoj Ziek locate sensual and erotic overtones in the movement of the dialectic. I argue that these approaches offer largely metaphoric readings of contradiction, duality, and the Absolute. In the second part of the article I argue that Hegel himself develops metaphors for these concepts in the Phenomenology, most notably through the motif of fruit. This motif brings out a contrast between a scientific conception of the Absolute and the erotic, contingent, and feminine' aspects of love. Significantly, the fruit begins as an image of wholeness and unity and ends as an image of unrestrained sensuousness. In this way, the motif evolves within the formal structure of the dialectic, forming an increasingly stark opposition to Absolute Knowing.",27,"WOS:000390995300005",3

Individual differences in alexithymia have been widely investigated, but no empirical studies so far have related alexithymia to reading. To fill this gap, we conducted two studies (combined N = 687) in which we assessed the links between alexithymia and reading frequency, as assessed by a performance -based task (i.e., a print exposure checklist) and self-report-questions. We also assessed reading attitude and mentalising ability as potential mediators of the association between reading frequency and alexithymia. The results showed that alexithymia was consistently associated with less frequent reading, and this relation was mediated by negative reading attitude and lower mentalising ability.

"English","Chartists; Emily Bronte; Francis Butterfield; Haworth; Luddites; Shirley",,"Speculation regarding Emily Bronte's supposed second novel has been rife ever since Charlotte's and Emily's names became known to the literary world. All three Bronte sisters had written or intended to write second novels: Anne Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was already in the hands of her publisher, T. C. Newby, by February 1848. Charlotte's second novel, Jane Eyre, was completed and published in 1847, and by late December of that year her third novel was struggling to be born, though it was making slow progress according to her letter of 15 February 1848 to W.S. Williams: 'As to my next book, - I suppose it will grow to maturity in time [...]'. Emily Bronte appears to have started a second novel, but the only evidence of this is in a letter to her from her publisher, T. C. Newby, also dated 15 February 1848. (Although this letter was not found in an envelope, it is folded exactly to fit an accompanying envelope addressed simply to Ellis Bell; the letter was almost certainly contained in another letter addressed to Acton Bell from their publisher. The letter is clearly not to Anne as it refers to a ' second novel',and Anne's second novel was already in the hands of the publisher.) Newby replies to a note from her, now lost, expressing his pleasure that she is working on a second novel and he encourages her not to rush to finish it. But what was its subject, and was it ever written? These questions remain unanswered. In this paper I will propose a possible answer to the first question, that is, the subject of the proposed work. Although speculative and incomplete, my theory may throw a little light on the alleged novel. It all starts with a curious anecdote, which surfaced in Yorkshire in the late nineteenth century.",20,"WOS:000419176500003",3

Analysis of his three novels for children published from 1941 to 1943 will consider how his works contributed, first, to the regime's attempt to forge and reinvent both real and imagined traditions through literature, and, second, to Fascism's drive to create a virile, physically and mentally strong youth. Offering a new perspective on Fascism's investment in and exploitation of sport, this article will reveal how a variety of the regime's policies, ideals, myths and goals were propagated and transmitted through fictional stories and adventures. The increasingly radical content and narratives will also show the regime's growing frustration at society's failure to respond to its mobilisation campaigns and increasing desperation following Italy's disastrous entry into the Second World War. Rather than hastening the maturity of young people to create a warrior race ready to risk all for the regime, Fascism's use of 'Boy's Own' heroes and fantasy space will be seen to have contributed to the illusion of strength that young Italians could not match and readiness that the regime could not offer.",94,"WOS:000403804900005",3

Critics and philosophers have understandably taken seriously Sterne's treatment of philosophy and have read Tristram Shandy in the light of the philosophers of the long eighteenth century, especially Locke and Hume. This essay will suggest that Tristram's sense of his shelf-mates in both philosophy and literature does not fit modern academic categories.

However, both these worlds are fictional constructs, set in the near future, allowing Atwood to critique trends in the contemporary world. Both worlds make disturbing and alienating reading, despite - or pehaps because of - the dark sense of humour that Atwood exhibits and the strange familiarity of her imagined worlds. Besides the more general concepts of the sinister and the eerie, Russian Formalism's defamiliarisation and Freud's unheimlich (uncanny) are employed to understand different aspects the alienating effects that Atwood achieves.

McKerrow, W. W. Greg and Fredson Bowers. Bibliography, in their definitions, is a scientific activity aimed at the construction of text as a ""material"" object. It has guiding principles that govern the quest for the ""definitive"" text where words are primarily iconic or indexical signs. To gloss words and sentences in support of a variant reading is a necessary evil, not something which is part of its formal principles. If textual bibliography were to accommodate some notion of annotations, as ""bibliograhie de l'erudit"", then we need to make a case for annotation as an essential feature of the bibliographer's exercise. This essay declares the legitimacy of annotation because it establishes the value of words well beyond the iconic or the indexical (the hitherto definition of the bibliographer's object of reading). To explore this the article examines the use, in particular, of ""numerology"" in Salman Rushdie, annotates at length four numbers, and makes a case for their value in the organizational and thematic patterns of his novels. It is argued that numbers are also part of Rushdie's interest in ""affects"" insofar as for Rushdie numbers are prior to cognition, they pre-exist consciousness and are not so much created as discovered. They also enter into the affective domain of being and are signs of the body's visceral intensities as well as an index of its nonvolitional proclivities. In making the annotations the essay also explores the importance of intercultural annotations by giving the example of pre-colonial Indian scholarship.",53,"WOS:000397221300011",3
"English",,,"Structures such as ""she muttered contempt"" or ""she smiled appreciation"" have been referred to as Reaction Object Constructions (ROCs), and consist of a normally intransitive verb followed by an object that conveys an emotion, such that the whole construction can be paraphrased as ""express an emotion by V-ing"". Although ROCs have been discussed recently in relation to Present Day English, from a historical perspective they have received very little attention, mentioned only in passing in historical reference grammars. This paper explores aspects of the history of ROCs, drawing on data from the Oxford English Dictionary and the Corpus of Late Modern English Texts, version 3.0. The findings show that, similarly to other processes of transitivisation such as the way-construction, ROCs have been in use since the fifteenth century, expanding to more verbs over the course of the Late Modern English period. More specifically, the data suggests that the construction was established mainly in the nineteenth century, a period in which those verbs attested in the construction became quite fashionable in novels. Findings are also subjected to a collexeme analysis, revealing the prototypical verbs of the construction during this period.",46,"WOS:000394789200006",3

I argue that, despite the neglect of his sportswriting by most critics, such excursions onto the playing fields are far from marginal to his intellectual and literary formation. I suggest that reclaiming Phillips as a ""sportswriter"" reveals how sport is central to his understandings of (national) belonging, (racial and class) identification, and (social) rejection and provides a useful analytical lens through which to better understand his reflections on diaspora and ""home."" In this regard, I draw out comparisons between Phillips and that other great Caribbean ""man of letters,"" C. L. R. James for whom sport, and in particular cricket, provided a window onto the world.

Suttee, if merely understood as the rite of widow burning in India, is one of the cruelest practices of female subjugation. Hence, women's attempts at articulating their views on such a practice are significant. This becomes more arresting when two women writers come from different (even opposing!) cultures and stand on different rungs of the colonial hierarchy. Moreover, given the flexibility of fiction as a mode of expression, it can arguably best be used as a powerful tool for one's own propaganda. Several questions emerge. How does each writer see and show suttee? How does an awareness of their respective status in an imperialist world shape their creative imagination? What kind of politics of representation is involved in their writings in face of the charged politics surrounding the topic of suttee in a colonial world? In depicting this rite, how and why does each bring in the argument of sainthood that is inevitably related with any suttee-death?

Hiswork demands a deeper contemplation of the conflicts that take placein the borderlands of cultures. This aspect makes up for the apparent limitedness in the quality of Japanese novels in the early modern period characterized by a lack of interest in life outside the national territory. Dealingwith issues concerning migration and Japan's imitation of the West, A Certain Woman underscores the conflicts at the point of contact between Japan and the West. As the novel focuses on ""migration as conflict,"" Arishima faces the ""mirror,"" reflecting the imagined ""West."" By using the motif of migration, the novel exposes the Japanese ""Western complex,"" a blind imitation of the Westthat is mostly obscured in modern Japanese literature. The significance found in the novel is in its view of the West as a mirror reflecting Japan, and conversely using Japan as a mirror to imagine the West. For the heroine of the novel, the people of the United States are the standard by which to measure up oneself. Imagining herself in the way the Americans might look at her, she has internalized Orientalism, a captive of the mirror that is the United States. If the fashionable society of the United States of America is an imagined West, diaspora is the narrative of an individual who has to leave her home behind to settle there.

In this context, A Certain Woman is a diasporic novel.

Furthermore, I situate these poems in a long genealogy of Melville's postal imagery that dates back to the early 1850s, especially the dead letters in ""Bartleby, the Scrivener"" (1853). In Melville's formulation, a dead letter refers not to a letter's death but to a suspended state where the letter fluctuates between life and death, waiting to be read and restored.

After a comparative analysis of the basic structure of the story, an evaluation of its variants, and an examination of the textual strategies it employs, the paper concludes with a short outline of a project for the computational analysis of large text corpora featuring animal tales. The example stories discussed in the paper serve as case study for the development of methods for computational comparative literature. The ultimate goal is the ability to conduct cross-cultural reading on a wide range of texts across a number of cultural contexts and languages, leading to a better understanding of the varying functions of talking animals within the long tradition of animal tales.",36,"WOS:000422844400002",3

This becomes worrisome from an ecological perspective when the powers steering the media are corporations whose primary concern is profit. Jeff Noon's science fiction novel Nymphomation provides readers with an instructive lens through which to examine such a coalescence between corporations and media technologies. The novel presents a mediascape saturated by corporate messages as leading to environmental deterioration but also imagines media technologies as a way to intervene in such situations through the practice of culture hacking. Culture hacking engenders creative practice, resulting in the amelioration of the environmental problems caused by the profit-driven logic of postindustrial capitalism. This representation functions as a metaphor for ecological advocacy, thus staging one of the roles ecocriticism hopes to play in mitigating environmental problems: identify and critique the cultural values and ideas that inform our current environmentally destructive practices.",20,"WOS:000406563200008",3

Specifically, this paper offers an exploratory overview of how writers from the 1880s onwards contributed to the social construction of television, and how this in turn shaped the medium' they themselves produced: literature. Based on texts by authors from pioneering television countries France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, this article identifies and discusses three layers of this media-historical dialectic: the general interplay between television technologies and literary imagination, the more specific interactions between industrialization and authorship, and finally the micro-level parallels between television's inner workings and the act of writing. Thus, the paper opens up perspectives for a more systematic study of the literary reception of early television.",63,"WOS:000414182300007",3

The control and discipline of Filipino/Ilocano-Hawaiian immigrants are installed through the iteration of normative rules involving identification categories of race, ethnicity, and class. The identification of white ideal however may get deflected in the crisscrossing and reception at the level of social praxis, as the attempt to embody a norm is never complete (Rottenberg). Such area of ambivalence may produce fissures that present critical space for the re-encodation of Ilocano-Hawaiian representation and agency. Of note is the seamless intrication between the history and the story, between texts and contexts, or conversely, between contexts and texts in selected GUMIL Hawaii short fiction.

We argue that the cinematic adaptation is less ambiguous towards the question of female authorship of the mathematical proof, but at the same time the hypertext refers to films and film genres that seem to amplify the protagonist's mental instability.

Morgan characterizes Marsalis in this way, presenting him as the monstrous product of military engineering and complicating this monstrosity by making Carl black. The novel works well as narrative, and the (anti)hero is undoubtedly appealing, while Morgan's discourse is quite solid.

I argue that, far from posing a barrier to his narrative, these interpolations constitute a crucial feature of his design of the work. Inset stories allow scope for his moral vision to emerge. The moral and spiritual meaning of travel is then drawn out through commentary, above all in the form of glosses that define the meaning of his observations and experience. This is also a work of considerable literary sophistication, distinguished not only by the author's religious sensibility but also by his fashioning of character portraits-vibrant studies of marginal European figures in India living in strained circumstances.

The short story collection Sonhos azuis pelas esquinas (2014), exploring the author's globalized identity, employs the vantage point of the globalized present to unravel the memories borrowed from the narrator's parents in order to come to terms with stark realities of the 1980s obscured by the earlier work's ideology.",31,"WOS:000414606900006",3

This sense of coherence, in turn, is more of an aesthetic effect than the result of epistemic validity drawn from that evidentiary abundance. In this article, I explore two different examples of archival magnitude: one is the fine-grained enormity of conspiracy discourse and the second is the large-scale quantities that power big data. These examples of archival magnitude are simply two narratives through which to explore the aesthetic and rhetorical operation of megethos. By redefining discourses that call on magnitude-the power of more-as aesthetic discourse, we may also find that the most fitting response is likewise an aesthetic one.",34,"WOS:000397005800004",3

The experimental phase of electronic literature when contemporary writers were establishing their identity by relating their poetics and ideologies to those of the modernist avant-gardes of the 20th century (a trend labelled by Jessica Pressman as ""digital modernism"") is giving way to a more ludic approach where e-literature is seeking out a larger audience via social media and in the language of social media (a tendency I call ""digital postmodernism"").

Therefore, the book stands within the tradition of the Enlightenment when it comes to educating the reader, and in a larger sense, believing in the social value of Bildung; yet, it simultaneously shows the limits of the Enlightenment frame by decomposing the linkage between moral knowledge and actual behavior. To pursue this twofold goal, the book intertwines traditional aesthetic forms with modernist goals, and demonstrates in the end the limits of applicability and fertility of both approaches in today's context and when - as the text suggests - consequentialist categories are applied. The text diagnoses the malfunctioning of the syncretism of Capitalism, Christianity, and the Enlightenment not only when it comes to issuing rules for moral behavior, but also when it comes to giving meaning to experience.

To describe Montale's late work as postmodernist is to measure the self-conscious distancing of his poetics from the writing of the first three volumes: the poetic voice of Satura explores the dialectic relationship between modern and postmodern. The common postmodernist annulments - the end of ideology, the end of history, the end of authorial presence, the distinction between high and low culture - all play a role in Satura's composition. The article includes a discussion of Cesare Vasoli's Tra cultura e ideologia as an important source to explain Montale's suspension of poetic output as a symptom of the political and philosophical disillusionment he experienced during the years of the reconstruction and the economic boom.

Symbolic self-translation in Modisane's autobiography involves attempts by the narrator-protagonist to untangle the conundrum resulting from what is presented as an unbridgeable chasm between the kind of person he could have been in a country devoid of racial oppression and what he was forced to become in the racially segregated South Africa of the twentieth century. Central to the analysis of Modisane's chosen mode of self-portraiture is James Olney's notion of ""metaphors of self"" in terms of which the autobiographical self seeks to articulate its elusive ontological status through metaphors and symbols.

Coetzee's novel, The Childhood of Jesus (2013), how the migrant is narrated into being as a subject over the divide between a previous life, which is being transformed into memory, and a future life, which has to be imagined before being realised. Drawing on Coetzee's own metaphor in Elizabeth Costello of writing fiction as constructing a bridge over a chasm between the real world and an imaginary one, as well as Calvino's similar metaphor in If on a winter's night a traveller (1979) of story being a bridge over a void, the article shows how the narrative in The Childhood of Jesus is located in, and constitutes a passage from, an unspecified past to an indeterminate future. The reader is reminded throughout the narrative of the void beneath the minimalist fictional bridge, and of the problem that the young protagonist, David, has with the logic of conventional numeracy - the hypotext for David's difficulty with numbers being Musil's novel, The Confusions of Young Torless (1906). Coetzee's novel expands the fictionality around the story of Jesus not only through the parodic resemblance of his young protagonist to the Biblical Jesus, but also through its intertextual use of works by Voltaire, Cervantes and Kafka, and especially the apocryphal Infancy Gospels with their miraculous and anecdotal stories about the childhood of Jesus.

It argues that a proper analysis of the genre requires a 'thick' description, a kind of close reading that takes into account both formal aspects and compositional conventions. Analysis shows that Gothic writers implement a number of construction strategies that can ultimately be tracked down to a set of binding 'rules' shaping and governing the genre.

This is in contrast to claims that Russian formalism was from the start inspired by Saussurean structuralism. Separating the foundations of modern literary theory from a structuralist paradigm allows us to disassociate the formalists' original claims for disciplinary autonomy from the subsequently developed theoretical proposition that literature is an autonomous system. By establishing that Russian formalist literary theory emerged within a paradigm which understood (poetic) language as a product of history, the article counters generalizations which cast Russian formalism as a movement which sought to isolate literature as somehow ""autonomous"" from society.",71,"WOS:000410253600005",3

To explore in more concrete terms the effect of reading WilhelmMeister's Apprenticeship, the article then turns to George Eliot's response in Daniel Deronda (1876). Goethe's novel appeals to the bodies of its characters and its readers. Eliot responds to this appeal by emphasizing that bodily reactions are themselves always shaped by history.

"English",,"'SODOM'; JORDAN,THOMAS; ROCHESTER","The assumption that the anonymous burlesque drama Sodom was written by a single author from within the libertine court of Charles II is reflected in the majority of the play's scholarly readings, particularly those that persist in accepting Rochester's authorship. In order to test this assumption, this article synthesizes and scrutinizes the principal sources of contemporary external evidence about the author of Sodom: John Oldham's 'Upon the Author of the Play call'd Sodom', Thomas Otway's 'Poet's Complaint of his Muse', and a manuscript fragment that has been understood to corroborate early attributions of the play to [Christopher] Fishbourne. Following upon stylistic tests conducted on Sodom for the 1999 Works of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, which confirm that long-acknowledged manuscript inconsistencies are indeed the result of multiple authorship, I argue that Fishbourne's suggested authorship accords with portions of a unique text of the play that reveals characteristics of his compositional style. At the same time, this gathering of evidence repeatedly associates Sodom with the London city poet Thomas Jordan, who appears linked to the play by Oldham and, less directly, Otway. While Jordan's involvement with the play's composition cannot be proven, I argue that his name at least stands in for a cultural formation of city ideology during the 'Restoration crisis' of the late 1670s and early 1680s. When taken together, these pieces of evidence support Harold Love's belief that Sodom's politics are 'anti-court' by promoting a view of it as a plebeian entertainment associated with city pageantry and the ballad tradition of Smithfield, not as a product of and for the court.",66,"WOS:000401071500005",3

In the works of Anna Lesznai and Anna Hajnal, the uncovering of the mythical layers of poetry is intertwined with the modes of expression of female identity. Lesznai's typical alter ego, Melusine, who is not accepted back by nature, breaks from her partner as well as her children.

The logic of this conceptual worlding is read through a cosmopolitan-vernacular optic, which presupposes that Ngugi's interventions can neither be defined as ethnically particularist nor as expansively cosmopolitan. Rather, his approach 1) combines multiple literary 'ecologies', in Alex Beecroft's sense, and 2) attempts to reroute the temporality of 'literature' so that it is no longer reducible to Eurochronology. What unites these interventions is that they both draw on and attempt to recalibrate 'world literature' as a symbolic value in response to a postcolonial predicament. Three texts provide the empirical focus of the article: the department circular ""On the Abolition of the English Department"" that Ngugi co-authored in 1968 with Taban Lo Liyong and Henry Owuor-Anyumba; the essay ""Literature and Society"", first written in 1973; and ""Memory, Restoration and African Renaissance"", which is the third chapter in Something Torn and New from 2009.",35,"WOS:000398110400007",3

The new materialist accounts of physicochemical processes in terms of their agentic capacities and generative powers have also fundamentally changed our understanding of the concept of agency. Taking the new ideas in the framework of material ecocriticism, this essay will focus on the expressive dimension of material agencies as ""narrative agencies,"" which are comprised of compound individuals, a concept developed by the process philosopher Charles Hartshorne much before the emergence of the new materialist paradigm, to explain the creativity, imagination, and experience found in nature's individuals such as atoms, molecules, cells, and nonhuman species.

By contrast, my ecocritical reading of Caryl Phillips' Cambridge (1991) reveals the extent to which non hum an landscapes in Caribbean fiction are paradoxically represented as categorically other. In Phillips' novel, this reification of the binary works in tandem with other sites of difference such as race and gender to expose how the very category of ""human"" is constructed through this process of othering. Instead of discussing the environment as a backdrop to the human affairs and relations that it may or may not influence, in Cambridge the environment operates as a form of ""nature-function"" that echoes Michel Foucault's analysis of authorship. For Foucault, the author is not the originator of meaning but a function of discourse, of the set of assumptions that govern the production, circulation, classification, and consumption of texts. Similarly, the notion of ""nature-function"" challenges approaches that foreground the environment as a pre-existing space that evolves outside of the subject and instead sees it as function of discourse.

The promulgation of Piers Plowman in multiple versions encouraged the scribal redactors of both manuscripts to reimagine the poem in creative ways. While the Ht redactor enhanced the role of Piers Plowman at the expense of the dreamer Will, the Z redactor offered a more sentimentalized version of Piers and often expanded the 'I' of the dreamer. By inserting himself into the 'I' of the dream vision, the Z redactor authorized his own compositions while simultaneously enhancing those 'monologic' moments at which the dreamer offers apparently authoritative interpretation of his visions. Z's most notable textual omission, which concludes the poem just before the tearing of the pardon, belongs to a consistent pattern in which the redactor eliminates moments of debate and opposition and expands passages of monologic commentary.

Hermann depicts the medial constitution of contemporary perceptions of everyday life and the appropriation of music by her characters, through which they compose their own individual soundtracks to their lives. The lack of a commentary on the songs' historical background seemingly leaves the reader with a mere passing sound of melancholy.

However, it was the 1840 introduction of Rowland Hill's penny post in Britain, alongside concomitant advances in American and European postal infrastructure, which led to a veritable explosion in the exchange of valentines, moulding the practice into a shape still recognisable today (see Golden 222). Hill not only democratised access to written communication by lowering prices, he also anonymised epistolary exchange. Prepaid stamps and pillar post boxes made it possible to correspond with anyone, anywhere, without giving away one's identity.

In Philip Roth's 1985 novella The Prague Orgy, his alter ego Nathan Zuckerman meets a woman writer named Olga, whose pursuit of the American writer owes more to erotic fantasy than to the milieu Roth recreates in otherwise faithful detail. This portrayal of the Czech female as both sexualized and ""other"" can be traced back to twentieth century Prague-German writers, but Roth both politicizes and intellectualizes this archetype by making the desiring (rather than desired) woman a writer and dissident. A real-life perspective on the Czech disidentka (female dissident) appears in the work of Dominik Tatarka, one of the few Slovak writers to be closely associated with the dissident movement. The last work Tatarka published in his lifetime was a memoir based on tape-recorded interviews with Eva Stolbova, who became Tatarka's connection to Prague dissident circles. In 1988, these Navravacky (Tapings) were published in edited book form in Germany, and it was not until more than a decade later that the full transcripts were published in Slovakia. While the female Czech dissident is eroticized in this text as well, Stolbova is not a mere object of desire; she portrays her side of the story in her own memoir, Lamento (1994).

The majority of these fragments are written in Latin, Middle Low German, or Danish, although a few in Old Swedish also survive. Five of these Old Swedish fragments are published and discussed in this article. They contain parts of two of St Birgitta's Revelations (Liber Caelestis and Revelationes Extravagantes) and of St Bernard's A Rule of Good Life (Ad sororem modus bene vivendi in christianam religionem). The Birgittine texts are from an early stage of the retranslation process when compared to other extant versions and include several unique wordings that demonstrate the specific use of the original manuscript in a monastic environment. The Bernard fragments are one of just two extant versions and may predate the version in Stockholm, Royal Library, A 9; as such, they are an important witness to the propagation of the saint's writings in Sweden.",22,"WOS:000415644800001",3

This paper examines the effects of word-final /s/, /r/, and /./deletion on preceding /o/from the point of view of production and perception. Regarding production, acoustic analyses of data from El Ejido (Eastern Andalusia), show specific changes to the F1 and F2 of /o/ depending on the underlying consonant it precedes (/s/, /r/, or /./).

"English",,,"The denouement of Charlotte Bronte'sJane Eyre contains multiple happy rewards for its heroine: a fortune, strangers turned friends turned cousins, the self-elimination of Bertha, and a Rochester still alive, still in England, and now free to marry. The hefty twenty-thousand-pound legacy (of which Jane only keeps one-fourth) bequeathed to her by her late uncle John Eyre allows Jane to return to the maimed Rochester and gleefully proclaim, I am an independent woman now (Bronte 501; ch. 37). Citing such financial independence, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar briefly mention Jane's inheritance as the event that allows Jane to follow her own will and marry Rochester on terms of equality (367). Similarly, Nancy Armstrong writes that [m]ore so perhaps than her virtue or passion, it is an endowment from Jane's wealthy uncle that makes her happiness possible (47). Other critics, such as Elaine Freedgood and Susan Meyer, focus on the origin of the fortune - Madeira - and suggest that such a colonially associated locale implicates Jane in the finances of colonialism and even of slavery. Unlike those critics, however, I will claim that Jane's complicated relationship to the inheritance distances her from the problematic taint of the money's colonial associations and marks her non-conformity with and resistance to the economic practices of the British Empire.",44,"WOS:000400962200005",3

I argue that Rilke mobilizes ambivalent imagery of the home to connect childlike misrecognition to the poetic impulse.

The present article reports the results of a detailed quantitative survey which tracks this diachronic event for approximately 350 years at the decadal level. The findings reveal with some precision the quantitative curve described by this failed change and enable a number of hypotheses to be constructed in relation to the event's nature, as well as its place within developments in the infinitival subsystem overall. In addition, the case study presented here suggests that failed changes are not necessarily capable of being modelled as a single Hubbert curve, as Postma proposes.

Confronted by what modern linguistics has termed 'first-language attrition', the writings of numerous exilic translingual authors exhibit a deep sense of trauma which is often expressed through metaphors of illness and death. At the same time, most of these writers make a deliberate effort to preserve what is left from the mother tongue by attempting to increase their exposure to poems, dictionaries or native speakers of the 'dying' language. The present paper examines a range of attitudes towards translingualism and first language attrition through the testimonies of several exilic authors and thinkers from different countries (Vladimir Nabokov's Speak, Memory, Hannah Arendt's interviews, Jorge Semprun's Quel beau dimanche! and Autobiografia de Federico Sanchez, and Eva Hoffman's Lost in Translation, among others).

In these, we discover portraits of criminals whose infamy was linked with and defined via the prism of animality. Through Newgate texts and engravings, the animal metaphor first appears as an ideological tool used to deprecate vile human beings who disrupted the law, linking their misdeeds to their apparent savagery. Such perception is necessarily stereotypical and schematic, reducing animality and criminality to sheer instinctualism. However, in their attempt to debunk the criminal code of the time, Newgate novelists also managed to twist such cliched vision of 'criminanimal' as an evil tandem, and to celebrate highwaymen as glamorous, free knights who denounced the Bloody Code. Such glamorization of the criminal encompasses the animal metaphor which turns out to be virtuous: through it, the animal becomes the criminal's equal and partner in glory: the 'criminanimal' is redefined, both criminal and animal fuse, queer one another and surpass the initial anxieties evoked by their tandem to become an erotically charged duet.",14,"WOS:000407697600007",3

The imperially patronized production of the Oriental tale as both a literary and a pedagogical form, exemplified by Mir Amman's Bagh-o Baha'r (The Garden and the Spring, 1804), among other works, began the process of the large-scale and nearly irreversible reorganization of North Indian literary traditions.

The discussion is set against a background of Caxton's printing of the translation of Cicero's De Amicitia, because Erasmus casts friendship as the context for appropriate communication between people from quite different education and training, along with the probable rhetoric that enables appropriate persuasion. The probable rhetorical stance of temperate friendship proposes a foundation for a common weal' based on a co-extensive sense of selfhood. This focus suggests that the familiar rhetoric set out in Erasmus' De Conscribendis epistolis draws on Cicero's rhetoric of sermo2 at the heart of friendship.3 It explores the effects of the rhetorical stance of probable rhetoric, both for personal and social writing, and for political action, and looks at the impact of sermo rhetoric on ideas of identity and civic politics in an age of burgeoning circulation of books (both script and print).

Lawrence series with the archive of Lawrence manuscript and other materials distributed in special collections of libraries around the world, collected mainly from the 1950s as his star began to rise. The essay considers the recent arguments of Suzanne Bost, making use of Jacques Derrida's argument in his essay ""Archive Fever"", about the inevitably preconditioned interpretation of archival materials (Derrida) and the need to give them air before settling into a program of editorial or other analysis (Bost). The present essay grants Derrida his case in theory but argues for a more pragmatic approach based on the fruitfulness of the archival enquiry and citing as evidence the lessons learnt over the four decades of the Lawrence Works series. The first lesson is the essential versionality of Lawrence's writings, which is only partially captured in the scholarly editions. The second is the deep relevance of book history to scholarly editing, which is yet to make its presence felt in the literary critical domain of Lawrence studies. Finally, in a coda, the essay envisions a future vehicle for the presentation of a versional Lawrence: a critical archive in digital form. Its technical features are described partly via a critique of the recent Oxford Scholarly Editions Online. Giving the reader easy access to versions of works written around the same time, both in facsimile and transcription, is one requirement. Collaborative commentary is envisaged.

In seeking to reclaim the lost experiences and objects of exploited miners, Rukeyser's project to salvage their anonymous suffering at the hands of capitalist greed places her as an artist within the historical materialist tradition outlined in Walter Benjamin's Theses on the Philosophy of History (1942). The Book of the Dead explores the legacy of European capitalism's displacement of the Native-American Asiatic' society as delineated by Marx in the Grundrisse (1939). It is argued that Rukeyser aims to salvage the signs and materials of industrial conflict, such as the insurrectionary figure of John Brown, in order to begin to create the always-unfinished symbol' against the misappropriating machinations of capitalism, continuing the work of poets such as Herman Melville. The essay argues that Rukeyser's symbolic framework which aims to spur the subjective worker to action through imagination invokes a 'Hydraulic state', as in ancient Egypt, inspiring a quasi-religious submission to the higher unity of the hydroelectric dam and those who died creating it. Finally, we explore the implications where this spur to collective working-class action depends upon the consciousness of the human conduit: the irony at the heart of Marxist autonomy.",25,"WOS:000432024900012",3

As Michel Foucault has noted, however, this was a process with the unintended potential of arousing admiration or sympathy in the spectator. In Spain the figure of the bandolero, despite crimes sufficient to take him to the gallows, was frequently presented in a positive light. The images in pliegos sueltos which commemorate bandoleros and other popular wrongdoers form part of a historical backcloth in which the bodies of those executed were exposed for the demonstration of the power that had brought them to justice. There are, however, elements in the sueltos which undermine the message of control conveyed by an execution. In the images at least, the most extreme forms of the suffering tend to be suppressed, although the details of crimes may be included with some detail. At the same time the text of the sueltos sometimes includes elements typical of a narrative of heroism that are strongly at odds with the images of wrongdoers brought to heel. Circumstantial details of the criminals may offset their depiction as worthy of condemnation, andin more active modetheir bragging stands in dramatic tension with a containing text of authority. The whole brings into question the place of the sueltos in a dynamic of state and people, of control and response, of heroism of the person versus submission to the law.

Though the expression itself has achieved wide appeal, few studies have explored what SBNRs believe about God, religion, or spirituality. This paper uses survey data from Wave IV of the Baylor Religion Survey (2014) and draws from the theory of ""cultural omnivorousness"" to show that SBNRs have significant sociotheological differences when compared to those who are both religious and spiritual (RAS). The expression ""spiritual, but not religious"" is more than a manifestation of religious deinstitutionalization or ""believing without belonging."" Rather, being ""spiritual, but not religious"" involves sociotheological boundary work that distinguishes SBNRs from traditional monotheists. When compared to RAS respondents, SBNRs are more likely to view God as a higher power or cosmic force instead of a personal being and are more likely to adopt an individualistic ethic as opposed to finding moral authority in God or Scripture. By examining the historical context and sociotheological characteristics of SBNRs, this paper locates a boundary between SBNRs and RAS monotheists and offers theoretical reasons why SBNRs engage in sociotheological boundary work.

The hermaphroditic images in Shakespeare's play not only point to a cultural fear of powerful females who, like Salmacis, have the capacity to overpower men but also indicate male sovereignty in the spiritual joining of the male/female body in marriage.",30,"WOS:000413711000008",3
"English","Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Sefi Atta; hotel; mobility; travel; unbelonging",,"The figure of the migrant has become a paradigmatic representative of globalised postcoloniality. Yet, not all postcolonial' mobilities can be equated with migration. Cases in point are the travelling African protagonists of two diasporic Nigerian short stories, Sefi Atta's Housekeeping' (2010) and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Transition to Glory' (2006). The short stories feature the figures of the African leisure traveller, tourist, and, in particular, hotel guest. The hotel articulates different dimensions of a site that is frequently conceived, both in fiction and in theory, as a place and symbol of in-between-ness, deviance and displacement. In Housekeeping', the hotel serves as a setting for exploring the socio-economic differences between migrant travellers and symbolises a sense of diasporic unbelonging. In Transition to Glory', the hotel room is used as a setting and symbol for an adulterous relationship. It comes across as a space of deviance which is not properly inscribed either in the private/domestic or the public. While set in spaces of in-between-ness and transit, both texts articulate metaphorical senses of longing for home. By analysing the literary representation of the hotel trope, this article contributes to widening the scope of how postcolonial mobilities can be understood.",26,"WOS:000404679300001",3

This revamping of her figure not only entails the erasure of the subversive potential of actresses' break with the public-masculine/private-feminine dichotomy, but it also works as an attempt at neutralizing the threat that these ""public"" women pose to the gender roles that became normative in the seventeenth century and that are still seen as such nowadays.",33,"WOS:000424554200010",3

Its second part attempts to demonstrate that even in the case of fragmented literary canon we often repeat the same ""elitist"" operation of power we criticize. Long before the emergence of modern literary studies organized through university departments and research institutes, properties of the good book were related to the evaluation of its rhetorical qualities, its dependence on poetic tradition and, above all, on its moral qualities. In twenty-first century there is no single criterion by which we can assess whether a book is good or not either in terms of its aesthetic or ethical properties. Thus, it seems that the answer to the question of good book would be as simple as it is paradoxical: there are good books and good books, old and new, classical and modern, good foreign and good domestic books, mostly written by great novelists and only few by great poets. In fact, the answer to the question of good book is problematic because it is difficult to find the clip that connects individual experience of the text and experience in general. Of course, the result is not disappearance of the concept of goodness (it still has certain content) but rather its vagueness. Therefore, caution is always needed in any generalizations, regardless of whether we generalize culturally or multiculturally. However, it appears that there still exists a small, almost invisible residuum of Erasmus's view of bonae literae in the fragmented contemporary literary canon: belief in the idea that literature has a value in itself.",16,"WOS:000405143000006",3

The analysis focuses upon Margin Call (2011) and Cosmopolis (2012), two films that draw from the genre commonly referred to as 'the thriller'. Both films are fictional and exhibit the interplay between systemic risk, the revision of historical conventions of the thriller, and financial crisis. Specifically, the narratives build their central dramatic tensions around representations of the persistent challenge to locate, quarantine, and coordinate networked responses against systemic risk, a challenge which comes to symbolise the fundamental struggle of a global financial culture. Within these films, systemic risk is represented through a new set of semiotic codes involving technology and mathematics, which work to join near-automated financial industries of late-stage capitalism with an appearance of human relevancy. When positioned against the rhetorical specifics of U.S. congressional hearings and news media reports about the crisis, a dynamic pattern about 'thrills' and risk begins to emerge wherein the films' representational fields and the adopted structures of the allegedly nonfictional, expert language form a reciprocal relation.",23,"WOS:000396780800004",3

After flying over the American interior in 1935, Stein increasingly saw the absolute designs of the American nation state as an aesthetic masterpiece, to be restored and preserved by a high genius of her modernist writing.

Through a series of philological investigations of some heavily modulated Chinese translations of David-Neel's writings, I show that the tripartite, interpretive dynamic between France, Tibet, and modern-day China cannot simply be reduced to a dualistic, unilateral, and static power pattern, since we see that the Chinese, despite being themselves ""Oriental,"" could, advisedly or unconsciously, produce falsified images of another ""Oriental"" entity placed at a less advantageous position through a French medium.",31,"WOS:000408990900006",3

Yet, Modiano, born in 1945, does not have first-hand experience of the event. His representation of this period of French history is foremost a (re)construction. It is also obsessive, as illustrated by the compulsive peregrinations of his narrators through the streets of Paris. Taking at its starting point the ambivalent 'places of memory' that pepper Modiano's novels, this article proposes to examine more closely the symbolism of one recurrent street name: the rue Lauriston, headquarters of the most infamous branch of the 'French Gestapo'. Rather drab and unpretentious, this street does not stand out in any way from Parisian topography. Yet, the simple uttering of its name makes present a troubled past, both at a collective and personal level. Not only does the textual inscription of the rue Lauriston motif reveal much regarding the author's relationship to the period of the Occupation, it is also indicative of his ethical preoccupations with the misdeeds of the past and need to resist cultural amnesia. Underpinned by Paul Ricoeur's and Roland Barthes's reflections on memory and photography respectively, and illustrating the discussion with examples taken from Modiano's first novel La Place de l'etoile, the article argues that Modiano's rue Lauriston represents a form of partial disclosure/un-concealment typical of this author's 'reticence poetics' (poetique de la reticence).",34,"WOS:000400571400019",3

As a peak sanitary crisis, the Great Stink helps us to understand the particular telepathy of Eliot's narrator, since The Lifted Veil combines the rhetoric of telepathy with that of a more threatening form of transmission among bodies: foul odor and contagious air. Throughout the figurative structure of Eliot's story, tropes that convey the narrator's ostensibly supernatural experience contain traces - sometimes cryptic, sometimes explicit - of the earthly matter of sanitary crisis. The first section of this essay explores the sanitary dimension of The Lifted Veil, linking the story to sanitary crisis and to Victorian materialist psychology - particularly the work of George Henry Lewes - which conceived mind in physical terms. With the role of sanitation established, the second section shows the importance of the sense of smell to Latimer's first-person narration of telepathy. This section outlines the transition, contemporaneous with sanitary reform, from the use of animal to the use of vegetable perfumes. Throughout the story, vegetable scents act as prophylaxes against the narrator's too-physical telepathy. From these readings, it becomes clear that Eliot writes extrasensory perception with recourse to sensory figures.

At the same time, though, what it lacked in extravagance was compensated for in creativity. The performance combined features from Grotowski's poor theatre and the carnivalesque.

This article, however, highlights the humanist idealism that lurks within the stories and-taking into account different ideas about humanity/animality, compassion, and recognition-proposes both localized and universalist readings of the stories. Playing on Hegel's and Fanon's ideas on the dialectic of recognition, the article shows that underneath the bleakness and desolation depicted in Hernandez's stories hides a profound yearning for recognition, restoration, and restitution. The only difference is that in the stories, recognition cannot be found in human relationships, but rather through animal-human relationships. In the stories, being in the company of animals or becoming an animal is a means for envisioning humaneness and empathetic processes of community-building. The stories expose the fallacies of a neoliberal citizenry reduced to an entrepreneurial morality, and instead yearn for acceptance of Otherness, empathetic recognition, and restorative justice.",50,"WOS:000417502200003",3

The credibility - the authority - of Fiammetta herself has often been particularly scrutinized.

The dynamic interaction between these two gendered polarities can be better understood in relation to the topological structure underlying both the Elegia and Boccaccio's biography. This conceptual map revolves around two main centres: King Robert's Naples, where Boccaccio spent most of his youth; and Florence, his hometown, to which he had recently, and reluctantly, returned.

Despite improvements in public health in the second half of the nineteenth century, the preoccupation with flies in late-Victorian England intensified rather than eased. This reflected in part changing environmental conditions conducive to the proliferation of flies, but also new attitudes, particularly among middle-class urbanites, towards the organisation of public space, and the place of animals within it. This in turn reflected contemporary developments in medical and biological science; along with broader attitudes to 'cleanliness' and 'dirt'. This article will examine the roots of the 'house-fly danger' in late-Victorian England, exploring contemporary debates in both the scientific literature and the popular press, and will discuss the surprisingly diverse ramifications of public concern about these insects.

This article argues that this model of hybridization on the border can point in the direction of a synthesis between the theoretical impulse of contemporary attempts to conceive of a world literary system, with their scale and their concern with models of circulation, and those of post colonial criticism and creolization theory, with their focus on hybridization and literary and cultural transformation on the periphery and mistrust of centripetal accounts of literary and cultural history.

At the origin of Wagner's thinking about absolute music is a striking metaphor: that of Beethoven as Columbus, exploring the sea of absolute music.

This article focuses on the origin and spread of national symbols and nationalism in nineteenth-century Colombia. It examines Colombian national symbols such as the coat of arms, the flag and the national anthem in order to determine how these national symbols were used in the early nineteenth century by a Colombian nationalist elite, composed of 'official intellectuals' to construct a 'patria cultural'. The article seeks to demonstrate that the national symbols produced and institutionalized in nineteenth-century Colombia were European imitations of French and German nationalist models and, therefore, were the results of the affiliation of Colombian republican intellectuals to the European liberal national project of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The article concludes that the construction of the nineteenth-century 'patria cultural' has ever since prevented the emergence of an organic and more democratic modern nation state in Colombia.",23,"WOS:000402672900006",3

The most ardent Hallyu supporters in Indonesia are women who are organizing massive urban fan gatherings, K-pop concerts, and group tours to Seoul. With a long and devastating record of state violence on Marxists, Chinese, and women in general, current public tolerance to Hallyu by the Indonesian government seems flimsy as female Hallyu fandom is threatening the mainstream Islamic value of feminine subservience. Although the strength of the local culture vis-a-vis Islam in Indonesia allowed an easy invasion of Hallyu into the country, the gender divide in the consumption of Hallyu is providing the Islam leaders with an easy excuse for possible state violence against women. Unlike Islamic, Western, and Japanese culture that are widely popular in the country, Hallyu's salient feminine following invites jealous and alarmed reactions from Indonesian Muslim males. As the Japanese and Chinese anti-Hallyu sentiments among the male population led to massive outbreaks of anti-Korean hate speeches and demonstrations against the Korean residents and Hallyu promoters in the two countries, this paper analyzes how the female fans in Indonesia and Palestine are reacting to such threats.",59,"WOS:000409131200011",3

"English",,,"The kinaesthetic sensibility of recent discourses on cosmopolitanism has tended to universalise and abstract representations of global connectivity. The materiality of culture-understood here as an object-mediated form of cultural exchange-has been neglected in favour of a critical attention to hybrid and vernacular modes of being. Through Bernardine Evaristo's novel-with-verse Soul Tourists (2005), I rearticulate cosmopolitanism as a specific literary praxis that takes into account the significance of material life. By tracing the novel's fascination with cars and (auto) mobility, I interrogate how the text assembles cross-cultural and cross-material connections that complicate prevailing notions of cosmopolitanism as hybrid subjectivity. While praised for its progressive ability to reimagine black Britain through a distinctly black European context, Soul Tourists has yet to garner sustained debate concerning the commodified life of objects, like the car, which reconfigure such politicised tactics of belonging. I argue that a focus on the car enables a crucial phenomenological shift whereby the sights, smells and sounds of objects-in-motion reveal unexpected and unexplored outer-national relations between inanimate forms and animate bodies. The vehicular cosmopolitanism of Soul Tourists sets up the car as poesis in ways that unsettle the humanistic assumptions of vernacular cosmopolitanism.",28,"WOS:000415826900002",3

The novel is replete with detailed historical analysis and intertextual references, but its narrative is also highly visual. From the perpetrator's gaze to the archive of perpetrator images that circulate in the text, the novel's visual objects are sites where violence is waged and imagined. Rather than depicting only the Holocaust and WWII, however, The Kindly Ones creates an alternative archive of images that brings this past into contact with Algeria, Vietnam, and 9/11. The novel not only offers images of war, it represents a ""war of images"" that evinces post-9/11 anxieties about the power of images to produce, and not simply represent, violence.

This essay tries to analyze how the exotic portrayals and images are constructed in American novels in accordance with Western indigenous culture and the general conception of Eastern inferiority in comparison to the superiority of Western civilization. With the pervasiveness of ethnocentrism, the Korean female images are portrayed as the Other and exotica of the East. Consequently, what they suffered in the calamity of war has been erased. However, similar female images that appeared in the Korean novels of the Korean War are far more complicated. They are relegated to a peripheral status in the national calamities wrought by the war. They are constructed within the frame of the absence of men's support in families, extreme poverty, and the legitimization of prostitution and breakdown of traditional Korean society and culture. In a word, the construction of these Korean female images conveys strong cultural and historical influences.",34,"WOS:000398392300012",3

Also the manuscript context corroborates the idea of parody. Another new element that I have introduced is a passage from an Old Irish text the Lebor Gabala Aerinn, which offers some remarkably close parallels to the opening lines of The Land of Cokaygne and shows clearly how The Land of Cokaygne works as a parody.

His use of the passive voice, his reflexive constructions, his counterfactuals, his unexpected expressions of uncertainty, the representation of an unknown person as a ""figure"" or ""shape""-what distinguishes Hardy's language from that of other novelists also draws attention to itself. Indeed, the category of artificiality has long been deployed to subsume the distinctive features of Hardy's literary form. But such a characterization captures what is unique to Hardy without considering its place or purpose within his aesthetic project. This study argues for the importance of these techniques as strategies of representation, showing that his unique forms convey features of represented experience not explicitly, by means of language's referential capacity, but obliquely, through particular syntactic structures and their semantic resonances. Diverse aspects of his novels, including the spatial field, thematic significance, the affect of wonder, perceptual salience, and the intrinsic limitations of romantic love all emerge through Hardy's distinct modes of linguistic representation.",18,"WOS:000395750700005",3

Shadwell had not read Tirso de Molina's El burlador de Sevilla, but instead, his inspiration came from France, specifically from Le nouveau festin de pierre ou l'athee foudroye by Claude La Rose, Sieur de Rosimond, which in turn revealed unquestionable borrowings from Dorimon's, Villiers's and Moliere's versions of the theme (Le festin de Pierre ou le fils criminel and Dom Juan ou le Festin de Pierre). All of these plays share serious overtones and vile Don Juan protagonists, which highly contrasts with the light-hearted treatment of the Don Juan story that was predominant in England and France through the nineteenth century. The passage from the seventeenth century's moralising vision of Don Juan to its humorous counterpart in Victorian times constitutes the object of study of this article, which traces the inseparable trajectories of Don Juanesque works in the two countries.

His name is invoked during elections and sporting events, and instrumentalised, if not ""commodified"" for electoral power gains with reckless abandon. Because Mandela symbolises many things, there are varied interpretations of his legacy, a conundrum that remains unresolved after the global icon's death. Theoretically grounded on Berger's (2014) ""myth model"", this article examines the discursive construction of Nelson Mandela""s sports legacy in the context of the FIFA 2010 World Cup, the maiden world cup extravaganza on African soil, in order to gain insights on how symbolic power is embedded in and is naturalised through texts and discourse. Empirical data for this article was gleaned through a corpus of purposively sampled archival press cuttings from three main South African newspapers, namely The Sunday Times, Mail & Guardian and The Sowetan. Data was coded thematically and subjected to discourse analysis using the her-meneutic approach. The article argues that the discursive constructions of Nelson Mandela in these newspapers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup projected Mandela's sports legacy through a mythological lens that accentuated his individual rather than collective contributions towards bringing the World Cup to South Africa/Africa. The article further argues that Mandela's sports legacy is depicted as inseparable from his larger legacy in politics and society, thus demonstrating the intricate link between sports and politics in post-colonial societies.",28,"WOS:000423794200007",3

This article explores the significance of such interactions through an examination of the relationship between Andrew Marvell's English political poetry of the 1650s and the work of Payne Fisher, Cromwell's poet, who produced a stream of major Latin works in that decade, issued in fine editions several of which were sent abroad to solicit international support for the Commonwealth and Protectorate. With the work of David Norbrook, Nigel Smith, Blair Worden, Nicholas McDowell, James Loxley, Paul Davis and others, the intertextual connections of Marvell's verse have been particularly well explored; but where Fisher's work has been mentioned in passing in relation to Marvell, comment has almost always depended upon Thomas Manley's workmanlike 1652 translation of just one of Fisher's works, not upon Fisher's Latin itself, and has depicted Fisher as the secondary poet, dependent upon or imitative of Marvell. The evidence suggests that the influence ran mostly in the other direction. Marvell and Fisher were both drawing on, and contributing to, a distinctive political poetry of the Protectorate, and our appreciation of both poets is improved by reading them alongside one another.",35,"WOS:000411084300007",3

Literatures that were born digital can show how rituals of readings, formulas of production and narratives are being modified in the twenty-first century. In this paper, we work on a very large and diverse domain: Digital Literatures circulating in Spanish all over the world, not only those created in Hispanophone countries. Our starting point is our own repertory: Ciberia, but also other digital collections such as LiteLab, IlovePoetry, Hermeneia, ELMCIP and ELO.

The claim that Lucy is a ghost projects a somewhat different light on the novel which may then be viewed as the spectral narration of a spectral quest for a spectral identity, and this insistent aspect of spectrality, which is frequently encountered in the novel's resourceful use of gothic elements, must be thought to problematize any notion of narration, quest, or identity that grounds itself on presence. Being uprooted from her native environment, in which she seems hardly ever to have taken root, Lucy often seems to stick vehemently to her Protestantism, defending it against the incursions of the Catholic environment in which she lives and works. But this is ultimately a surface opposition which has more to do with the public performance of identity and which is largely at odds with the much more fluid field of identity determined by processes of varying and unstable identifications and speculations, in which Lucy enters as a speculating and spying ghost. What underlies the surface opposition between Catholicism and Protestantism are the various desires and fears that Lucy experiences in the project of finding a home for her own ghostly self.

"English",,,"The Ndau and Manyika people are well known for their craving for education, commonly regarded as ""school"" among the speakers of the two dialects. They are also popular for their love for code-switching between Shona and English. In his anthology of Ndau and Manyika poetry, Nhekwe Dziri Kanyi (2011), Ishmael Penyai focuses on many issues, among them: love, the family and education. On education, the poet expresses his vision of the ideal learner, teacher, school head and school curriculum - a vision which the researchers believe is an epitome of the dialect speakers in question. This article is an examination of Penyai's view of education in terms of the above-mentioned. It observes that the poet calls for learners to put first things first, by acquiring education before pursuing such things as sexual relationships and urges them, together with teachers and school heads, to be well behaved and cultured in a bid to facilitate knowledge and skills acquisition. In addition, he also widens learning to include such disciplines as music and sports and urges learners to pursue those disciplines they are good at and comfortable with. The article points out that whilst the poet is right in his call for remarkable behaviour among learners and the practitioners, his vision does not take into account why they fail to live in accordance with the ideals. It concludes that whilst Penyai's vision is plausible and wider than previous perceptions of education, it still needs further sharpening for it to actualise people's expectations.",22,"WOS:000405334200009",3

(original title Snill) by Gro Dahle and Svein Nyhus was published 2011 and immediately gained a large audience. The book tells the story about a girl who always behaves in the ways expected of her: she never confronts her parents, her teacher or her classmates. This behaviour makes her invisible; she disappears into a wall, causing those around her to take notice. After a while, she fights herself out of the wall, emerging a completely different girl, a strong girl with a will of her own. However, she does not come alone: she has taken with her all the silent females, who had disappeared into the wall before her. The picture book story has fascinated both young and adult readers, and many student teachers have discussed it as part of their curriculum at university. The experienced reader will find intertextual relationships to other texts, where women disappear into the wall such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper (1899) and Patrice Kindl's The Woman in the Wall (1997). The less-experienced reader will encounter a fascinating story of a girl fighting for her freedom and self-esteem. This article will present a multimodal analysis of the cover page and some significant spreads building on social semiotic theory and tools for analysing multimodal texts.

At the heart of each version is a reworking of the opening chapter of Book IV of the Dialogi of Gregory the Great, the focus of which is an analogy comparing the epistemological limits facing humanity to the situation of a youth born in prison. Scholarly attention has focused primarily upon the different continuations of the two versions of Napier I and their connections to Archbishop Wulfstan II of York. This article, however, is primarily concerned with the reworking of the Dialogi in the early part of the homily. My analysis shows how the Anglo-Saxon homilist consistently reworks Gregory's Latin in ways that reflect the different concerns of the two writers. Where Gregory was concerned with providing reasoned, intellectual arguments to support belief in the mysteries of the faith, the author of the common core of Napier I adapts the Latin text for preaching purposes. As such, the text of Napier homily I both witnesses the importance of the Dialogi as a source in Anglo-Saxon England and provides an insight into the freedom with which such authoritative Latin sources could be adapted and reshaped by vernacular homilists.",49,"WOS:000401071500001",3

Beginning with a reading of the storm and shipwreck, this article argues that the play produces and reproduces itself through salvage. The actors, costumes, properties and language that the Act One catastrophe disperses continually persist and recollect, forming the larger ecology of the play. This ecology of salvage extends from the fiction of The Tempest to its stage materials, as garments, hand properties and set pieces, which were recycled from prior early modern contexts into theatre storehouses and found their way onto the stage. What is emphasised by the constant recycling of the wreckage that the man-made storm leaves in its wake is that the past continues to exist in the present despite being transformed by human catastrophe. Ultimately, because the remainders left by the storm survive the very devastation they constitute, the play may be said to speak to a contemporary ecocritical desire to envision ways that people and things already endure man-made disaster.",31,"WOS:000405718900006",3

The poet of The Phoenix's expansions have been dismissed as prolix, yet when examined in light of similar passages elsewhere in the corpus of Old English literature, these additions can be seen to introduce images of particular resonance. This essay will focus on the landscape of the poem's opening to argue for the Anglo-Saxon poet's introduction of a distinctively insular spatial imaginaire to the setting inherited from the Latin source material.

We have then tested 60 translators in another procedure, so as to check whether there were statistically valid links between a verb's typicality and the choice of a translation equivalent. The results indicate that a higher degree of prototypicality positively correlates with a more consistent choice of a translation equivalent. At the same time, there is a negative correlation between the determined prototypicality and the diversity of translation equivalents offered for the verb in question.

In a post-9/11 context, Saturday engages with catastrophic imaginaries and social anxieties by illuminating the entanglement of the spaces of terror with the bodily and more specifically the neurological dimension. If genetics and neuroscience have spatialised our bodies in novel ways, this article shows how in Saturday the architecture of the brain is made to relate to the larger networks of the city and how the city, in its turn, becomes the lens through which international scenarios can be visualised. This interconnectedness is reinforced by the theme of catastrophe whose key is struck at three different pitches: the genetic risk endangering the individual; the urban risk jeopardising the family; the global risk threatening civilisation. The illegibility of the post-traumatic space is resolved symbolically through the conduit of the somatic self. Corporeality frames the whole novel: the incipit echoes the innatist portrayal of body and mind predicated by neuroscience; the end suggests our biological predisposition to human empathy and implies that only a narrative of human interconnectedness (both scientific and artistic) can reconcile us with the world and ourselves.",52,"WOS:000401448100012",3
"English","Thomas King; Green Grass Running Water; Native American identity; Ethnicity; Hybridity",,"The paper analyzes the elements that constitute Native American identity in Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water (1993). In the novel, King juxtaposes two ethnic identities, white Christian American, representing the majority in the American society, and Native American, representing a minority. King portrays the struggle of Native Americans in the US and Canada to define their identity given the historically long rift between their native heritage and the white culture. Stigmatized for their ethnicity and race, Native Americans were exposed to marginalization and prejudice and forced to somehow overcome this position. The struggle has been made more difficult by the efforts of the dominant society to assimilate them and at the same time prevent them from claiming full citizenship. King carefully weaves the stories of his characters, who constantly go back and forth between the reservation lands and the outside world, having to find their position in both and usually not belonging to either. By focusing on the world of the reservation, Native American spirituality, tribal tradition of storytelling, and creation myths, King examines different aspects of Native American ethnic identity and, through juxtaposition of the Native American ethnic identity with that of the dominant society, reevaluates the marginalized position of the Native Americans.",12,"WOS:000400571400013",3

In the Russian literary canon, Kuzmin has not obtained the high status he deserves because his openly gay writings are not acceptable either under homophobic Soviet law or by today's official anti-LGBT Russian mindset. Interestingly, despite the poet's notorious reputation, the homosexual core of 'The Trout' has been consistently ignored in most critical analyses. Nor has the other side of Kuzmin's homosexuality, his misogynism also an important part of 'The Trout' been discussed so far. Dissolved in rich intertextuality, symbols and rhetoric, it is responsible for the ambivalent portrayal of the heroine. She is a Psyche who patronizes the love between the two male protagonists but also a femme fatale who drives one of them, who becomes her lover, to death. Women were avenged later, in Anna Akhmatova's 'Poem without a Hero', a tribute to her 1920s romance with Ol'ga Glebova-Sudeikina, which was inspired literarily by a rivalry with Kuzmin, especially his 'Trout'. The poetess' inherent Lesbian agenda led to a covert reworking of Kuzmin's gay poetics, which was programmatically open about homosexual love being more rewarding and less tragic than heterosexual love. As the 'Poem's hidden real message has been ignored even by scholars for fear of diminishing Akhmatova's reputation, 'The Poem' succeeded in eclipsing Kuzmin's more genuine and artistically daring portrayal of bisexual triangular love that flourished in the Silver Age.",50,"WOS:000401045000005",3

It focuses on the visual aspect of the debate, tracing the white-supremacist foundations of the Washington team's insignia to the institutional construction of Native identity through popular Indian head pennies, gold coins, and buffalo nickels in the period between 1859 and 1938. Pointing at the seemingly paradoxical discrepancy between the minted messages and the systematic political, legal, and military invasion on American Indian sovereignty in that period, it proceeds to deconstruct the paradox by exposing the numismatic pictorial language as a manifestation of the same ideological project and the configurations of power that have remained unchanged to this day. The continued circulation of indigenous-based iconography in the contemporary American context shows that the same cultural imagination continues to serve not only as a powerful rationale for European America's historical, national, and political narrative but also as a form of ""anti-conquest"" that both obscures and enacts the established formulas of colonial domination and control. Observing the alterations of the Washington Redsk*ns logo design across some of the key socio-historical moments of the second half of the twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first century, the analysis explores how various forms of national anxiety transcend into identity through the politics of representation. In that light, it regards recent activism against mass-mediated symbolization of indigenous identity as an important arena in which centuries-old hegemonic discourses are contested against new venues of self-determination and internal decolonization.",55,"WOS:000400571400010",3

The interaction of the clients of Westworld (guests) with the highly developed androids (hosts) is based on the concept of fully immersive experience created using partly pre-programmed and partly improvised narratives written by the corporation running the park. Westworld is a high-end theme park where the visitors can enjoy realistic experiences through guided interaction with the hosts. The park thus becomes a place that, according to Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, becomes an intersection of the culture of presence and the culture of meaning. The immersive experience is so strong that meaning is secondary, reflecting Erick Felinto's premise that the human quest for experience, excitement and emotions is a consequence of the diminishing need for information and meaning. In Westworld, it is not only the androids who go on a journey of self-awareness, looking to understand and eliminate who defines them, but also some of the guests for whom the (mostly) predictable virtual world becomes a chance to seek unexpected and new experience physical pain, or even death. The Baudrillardian hyperreality and the multiplication of simulacra in Westworld reveal how human consciousness (and ultimately perhaps also the consciousness of androids) is affected and determined by the use of devices, artefacts and systems that create their reality. In the fictional world of Westworld, the most defining factor is interaction based on immersion into a narrative experience which, consequently, aids the development and awakening of androids and contributes to the dehumanization of people.",30,"WOS:000414234700004",3

I argue that tackling the issues of emigration, integration and belonging, Mikes employs a mock-anthropological approach: ironically reworking the notions of observation and imitation as survival strategies, HTBA grasps the absurdities underlying both British life and the newcomer's struggle to blend in. The two sequels Mikes wrote to HTBA decades later demonstrate that once the ""alien"" has been successfully integrated, the sense of acquired Britishness only produces further absurdities. Examining HTBA and a selection of his other works, I also claim that Mikes's satire is an unacknowledged contribution to the modern philosophical tradition of ""strangeness"" (exemplified by authors ranging from G. Simmel to H. Arendt, Th. Adorno and Z. Bauman). Today, Mikes's legacy continues to inspire expatriates living in London and elsewhere. However, his emblematic work has also inspired a stream of books with diametrically opposite intentions: these encourage their native readers to regain their allegedly fading socio-cultural heritage.

If we accept the premise that literary figures can serve as ethical models, the possibility of cross-cultural communication presented by Lahiri and Mihalis seems especially relevant in the contemporary context of intersecting migration routes and cultural flows. Although produced by authors from different cultural traditions, the narratives discussed promote a transcultural ethics that reveals the importance of shared values as antidotes to cultural collision.",27,"WOS:000405143000009",3

It then takes a closer look at the Essay and asks how the focus on uneasiness in Book II might qualify both the argument against innateness in Book I and the treatment of the doctrine of the succession of ideas. It re-interprets that doctrine, with Locke's conditional support as a succession of uneasinesses, and makes one final visit to Shandy Hall to consider the critical role of conscience.",14,"WOS:000395155000003",3
"English","Contemporary Nigerian poets; counter-hegemonic discourse; myth-making; power; truth","DISSIDENCE; ENGLISH; ART","The paradigmatic antagonistic relationship between the Nigerian poet and the despot in his guise as a military ruler has often been examined in terms of a hegemonic contestation of power between unequal rivals. The military state's typical response to the poet's ""truth"" with the display of excessive might, often involving the emblematic battering of the poet's tongue by the imposition of silence even in its eternal form of death, entrenches the notion of a powerful antagonist pitted against a weak opponent who nonetheless incarnates the spirit of the masses. A close reading of anti-military Nigerian poetry, however, underscores that the situation was replete with paradoxes: the inability of power to ignore apparent powerlessness; the ultimate triumph of powerlessness over power; and the fascinating replication in the counter-discourse of the (discursive) strategies of the dominant hegemony it battles against. This study highlights these trends in contemporary Nigerian poetry inspired by military despotism by paying particular attention to the work of the ""third generation"" of Nigerian poets.",44,"WOS:000397221300009",3
"English",,,"The phenomenon of Christian captivity in the Barbary states of North Africa constituted one of the most challenging instances of cultural encounter in the early modern period.

""Turning Turk""-the common phrase for conversion to Islam-came about for a number of reasons, captivity being prominent among them. Critics such as Matar, Robert Davis, Daniel Vitkus, Linda Colley, among others, have told this story from a variety of historical and literary perspectives, offering insight into religious conflict, national identity, and stage representations in order to tell the story.

"English","The Calcutta Chromosome; Amitav Ghosh; narratology; epistemology; Indian literature in English","SCIENCE; FICTION","The plot of Amitav Ghosh's The Calcutta Chromosome is so complex that there is little consensus among scholars on what actually happens in the novel. Following in the footsteps of Rabindranath Tagore, Satyajit Ray, Renu, and J. P. S. Uberoi, Ghosh dramatizes the encounter between Western science, with its accompanying epistemology, and Indian tradition. The novel challenges the relentless West-driven search for knowledge, epitomized by the supercomputer named Ava, and suggests that only different epistemological premises, based on silence, can counteract Western rationalism. The novel's literary technique mirrors this preoccupation in that it tells a story from two different viewpoints, one of which remains silent throughout. Narrating the viewpoint of a silent agent raises a number of problems as to the reliability of the narrator, who properly speaking is only a ""guesser."" The whole narrative revolves around a foundational mystery that remains unknown to all characters. In order to do so, the implied author must write about something of which he too remains ignorant. This paradoxical condition calls for a revision of the traditional writing agents as described by Wayne C. Booth, so that it is necessary to include the figure of the archiauthor behind the traditional implied author. This may explain a reticent narrative that relies heavily on the reader's intelligence. Furthermore, my narratological reading highlights two themes formerly neglected by scholars, namely that subalterns' cosmopolitanism in the future is rooted in our colonial past and that the interpersonal transference envisaged by the novel merges different people in one body, thus challenging the Western obsession with individualism.",54,"WOS:000393150300002",3

Additions to the poet's Latin source can function to reinforce for his Anglo-Saxon audience the theological sense of the psalms he translates, to add a degree of exegesis, and even (at times) to create a moment of poetic intensity. Such possibilities do not entirely acquit the poet of the charge of pedestrian verse production, but they do suggest that he has not always been given enough credit for his achievements.

Investigation of literary representations of episodes and personalities from Roman history has received much less attention. The influence exerted by that emergent sense of national self-awareness resulted in modifications of the received accounts of Roman history along thematic lines that rendered the Roman past more compliant with English national identity. An analysis of seven extant Elizabethan and Jacobean plays featuring Julius Caesar shows how his character was rewritten as a symbolic archenemy of the country. This re-writing of Roman history might have offered, at least to a certain type of elite readership, an imaginative space in which a sense of national unity could be strengthened by way of contrast.

Rene Girard's theory has been confirmed by the latest neuron system research findings. Bakhtinian dialogical hermeneutics linguistically frames the former accounts in terms of both successful empathic human communication and its failure when the right conditions for it are not met. The relevant textual and contextual aspects of Rushdie's life narrative including the fatwa affair as thematized in Joseph Anton are included in the present analysis with a view to explaining the causes for Rushdie's defense of parrhesia. Parrhesia, as defined by Foucault, explains Rushdie's central concerns after the fatwa, and the defense of free speech becomes a central empathic strategy deployed in Rushdie's memoir. Joseph Anton' s highly empathic textuality is shown to rely heavily on Rushdie's intertextual exploration of The Moor's Last Sigh in the memoir. Rushdie's life narrative adds empathetic momentum by means of a very apt use of this and other relevant intertextual allusions, especially to Ernest Hemingway's theory of literary truth.",42,"WOS:000400593600013",3

However, as the importance of otherness in the construction of Basque identity dwindled in favour of a process of self-analysis and revision, so will the relevance of the matriarch, and its demise will allow the expression of Basqueness through the modernization of identitary spaces that articulate the heterogeneity of its own population rather than through the simple maintenance and recurrence of instances of otherness.",36,"WOS:000407407200004",3

The first of these is Ortega y Gasset's razon vital, which places the contemplation of the problem of life at the centre of artistic endeavour and also emphasizes the importance of circumstances in the contemplative process. The second is Lorca's duende, which identifies the struggle with a truth-bearing and creative power as the artist's essential task.

"English",,"'MODEST-PROPOSAL'","The present essay argues that the notion of politeness spans the distance between two disparate views of the Modest Proposal: one in which Swift is detached from his speaker, and another in which Swift is complicit in his speaker's brutality. Swift's essay can be seen as an attack on politeness in two ways. In the first, Swift attacks presuppositions about politeness of the sort embraced by contemporary Whigs, whose spokesmen were eager to regard it as yoking civility with natural benevolence. While Swift's speaker is superficially modest, his barbaric proposal shows that the putative link between politeness and kindness is spurious. The second way in which the Modest Proposal attacks politeness involves Swift's regard for his own idea of it. While Swift believed that politeness entailed self-command-the suppression of one's asocial impulses-his various writings on politeness suggest that he nonetheless found the rigors of self-command vexing. As an ironic satire, Swift's work attacks self-command in the process of embodying it. A comparison of the Modest Proposal with one of Swift's non-ironic proposals for dealing with the poor reveals clearly the hostility and the impulse to self-aggrandizement that Swift had to suppress in order to write the Modest Proposal.",37,"WOS:000413904900006",3

In the poem ""Rhythm and Blues,"" Baraka writes, ""The people of my life / caressed with a silence that only they understand."" The line appears amid a long improvisation on the iconography of black vernacular life. In the middle of this cacophony of frantic chant and scream, Baraka posits silence, and not speech, as the condition of black cultural distinctiveness. In doing so, he presents a vision of black vernacular culture that does not privilege orality and expression but instead deems silence to be essential in the construction of a black commonplace. Baraka posits three interrelated forms of black silence: the silence of oppression, the silence of resistance, and the silence of social optimism. In the perceived absence of expression, the poems from The Dead Lecturer communicate a history of systematic violence, of fugitive withholding, and of communal goodwill. To borrow a phrase from poet and critic Fred Moten, they articulate ""an intimacy given most emphatically, and erotically, in a moment of something that, for lack of a better word, we call 'silence.'""",47,"WOS:000419238500005",3

The inscription, often read and sometimes misread, has a lengthy critical history given its sensitive location in the great ceremonial passageway between St Mark's Basilica and the Doge's Palace, the nerve centres of Venetian religious and political power. It is also the focal point of an intriguing sculptural ensemble whose problematic dating is also at stake in the investigation. The critical disarray over the chronology of our public text is such that it has been assigned to various points between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries.

The direct-reference theory of names explains only a subset of the phenomena of fiction and explains away the rest as irrelevant or pseudo-problems, whereas some criticisms of that theory bring in metaphysical concepts that may obscure the issue. This paper suggests that the indeterminacy of fictions and the conventions of the aforementioned practices are sufficient basis for explaining and assessing such counterfactual claims. In this view, fiction ceases to be understood as a phenomenon sui generis; it is instead an institutionalized use of the stipulative or computational aspects of language that are at work in other areas as well.

Picking up where some of the contributors to this recent volume left off, this article evaluates a major part of Hofmann's poetic career through a focus on his cosmopolitanism, and is an attempt to find out what sort of cosmopolitan poet Hofmann has been, at a time when his poetic voice has gone mostly quiet. Hofmann's poetry is explored on its own terms and through the prism of some recent sociological and other theoretical writing on cosmopolitanism, including the idealistic Europeanist and globalist work of Gerard Delanty. The investigation begins with a close-read and contextual analysis of the cosmopolitanism of Hofmann's Nights in the Iron Hotel (1983) and, especially, Acrimony (1986). Though these works deploy a variety of anti-imperial figures, I suggest that their way of using European culture to hold Hofmann's father, the author Gert Hofmann, to account for the displacement suffered by his poet son adds up to a powerfully internalized but ultimately Eurocentric form of cosmopolitanism. The article goes on to contrast this early phase of Hofmann's writing with the poems of Corona, Corona (1993), with special emphasis on the Mexico-set travel sequence at the end of that book. I argue that it is in the expansively historical and materialist poetry of this later volume where Hofmann stages a memorably polyglot encounter between local and global forms of capitalism through an awareness of shared yet differently ""rooted"" inauthenticity-that this writer approaches the limits of his and ""British"" poetry's cosmopolitan imagination.

"English","Fredric Jameson; postmodernism; American postmodern literature; cultural studies; critical theory",,"The purpose of this essay will be to delineate how Jameson has positioned certain American postmodern novels throughout his career, and how the restrictions he has placed on them have denied a range of interpretive possibilities. Through a consideration of specific types of textual interpretation overlooked in Jameson, we are able to investigate the ways in which his categorisation of postmodernity becomes circumscribed in interesting and illuminating ways. Despite a rarity of close readings, there are a number of brief, instructive comments on postmodern literature in Jameson's body of work. In considering these types of references, to authors such as Pynchon and others, it becomes obvious the extent to which Jameson's personal preference mirrors the way the texts are allowed to function. Through this analysis, it is also possible to see how a reconfiguration of some elements in Jameson's postmodern work may still be useful for contemporary criticism that seeks to widen the scope for readings of American postwar literature.",28,"WOS:000401448100008",3

While Pascale Casanova's influential account of a relatively autonomous 'world literary space' follows the work of Pierre Bourdieu in applying economic metaphors to processes of world literary value production, this essay argues that Casanova's 1999 account needs to be updated in light of recent economic and cultural developments: the economic and the literary sphere are no longer separate but fundamentally entwined, which means that processes of world literary value creation cannot be modeled as a pseudo-market. The essay traces ongoing debates on the transcultural circulation of Holocaust memory to put forward a more flexible and multifaceted model for the production of world literary value. To demonstrate the claim that world literary value is today articulated with other forms of value, the essay investigates the role of Holocaust memory in the recent world literary consecration of Roberto Bolano, Karl-Ove Knausgaard, and Elena Ferrante. Concentrated around New York-based publishers and media, these three cases not only demonstrate the crucial role of Holocaust memory in articulating literary value, they also show the recent shift from Paris to New York as a primary center of world literary value production.",58,"WOS:000398110400005",3

I firstly discuss this relationship, arguing that literature is not ethical per se, which is the reason why it can serve ethical purposes. Secondly, I state, in line with Martha Nussbaum, why any ethical thinking today has to refer to global ethics. Drawing from this, I present three recent novels, all of which deal with fundamental twentieth century atrocities: Burnt Shadows by Kamila Shamsie, The French Art of War by Alexis Jenni and The Walnut Mansion by Miljenko Jergovic. They pose philosophical and ethical questions about war, violence and the great ruptures of civilisation. They are a component of world literature in the sense that the plot, and the ethical reflection triggered by this, is not related to a single nation state, but to the global situation. The authors make use of a historical profile encompassing a period of 60 to 100 years of narrated time. In this way, they can make a connection between personal and historical-political development visible. But this connection is less ensconced in the material history of the facts than in an ideology and ""culture"" that is responsible for the permanence of war and violent conflicts. The involvement of the characters in conflicts proves to be more than just a matter of character and of personal attitudes; it is also the result of social constellations.

Employers and their servants are caught in a dynamic of dominance and submission, in which they practice mutual surveillance. Yet the relationship may also evoke models of loyalty, devotion, and the possibility, in fiction at least, of female alliance. On the comparatively rare occasions that servants feature at all in Victorian fiction, these dynamics lend a homoerotic dimension to the cross-class relationship between mistress and maid. The positions of mistress and maid bring two women together under the same roof while separating them by class, thus providing a framework for a fictional exploration for yearning, desire, unrequited love, or sometimes union. Alternatively, a queer relationship may be obscured by the guise of employer and servant. Indeed, the mistress-maid stories discussed here often involve masquerade in some form, including cross-class and cross-gender disguises.",55,"WOS:000400962200006",3

This paper argues that the differences between British and German writers in economic terms have been overstated. British copyright law did not in fact serve the interests of writers to the extent that has traditionally been supposed. In Germany and Britain the situation of writers was determined more by the underlying economics of the publishing trade, especially the high cost of book production, which enabled publishers to pursue monopolistic practices and tilted the tables in favour of publishers and against writers. This argument has further implications for our understanding of the politics of German literature in the late eighteenth century.",29,"WOS:000413790100005",3

Most captivating, if little known, is Durham, University Library, MS Cosin V. iii. 9: witness to the verse collection known as The Series, in which disparate exemplary, confessional, and didactic texts are organised as the purported compositions of the 'Thomas' of the frame narrative. The stage seems set for an insight into medieval authorial anxiety, patronage, and even mental infirmity, of apparently unprecedented candour. Yet for all his disarming claims to ineloquence, insignificance, and (famously) 'meetrynge amis', Hoccleve is a poet creatively alive to the possibilities, and dangers, of self-identification. He adopts in his poetry the double visage of laureate, yet servant; public man, yet ostracised clerk. Though his speakers may really report autobiographical truths of the poet, the poet may frequently refer only to a namesake of himself-mediated through literary convention-in his speakers. Such is the focus of this article, which considers-adopting a narratologist vocabulary-Cosin V. iii. 9 as an example of a work, and artefact, that bears an almost Renaissance sense of the individual's propensity to self-fashioning, but that is better encapsulated in a term of a distinctly medieval flavour, doublenesse. The discernment of such doublenesse, I suggest, offers a means of ascribing value to Hoccleve's still neglected corpus that extends beyond historicism alone, and a pathway, perhaps, for an alternative view of literary authority in late medieval literature. In The Series, emotion is concealed behind convention, the maker behind his text; but despite Hoccleve's diligent control over the words on the page, as for their interpretation by his audience, that, he must finally concede, 'can I nat knowe'.",50,"WOS:000403574900010",3

Gataker defines marriage as an affective contract between two agents with responsibilities to one another, and offers practical and generic precepts for conduct. The dedication to Robert Harley honouring Brilliana Harley as a mirror of the ideal wife links those ideals, rhetorically at least, to the Harleys. Harley's extensive extant correspondence (1625-44) allows us to consider the practical day-to-day significance of the sermon's teachings.

During the 1640s, when civil war raged and her husband was absent, Harley governed the household, sheltered a godly community, and withstood a royalist siege justifying her position in terms of natural law.

However, his critique of the 1880-1890 opera performances stands alone in its own right as the most influential early modern critical discourse on music drama in the British milieu. In the wake of his early enthusiasm for Wagner- a trait that pervades his writings on music during the late 1800s but nonetheless declines with the turn of the century-Shaw's opera criticism suggests a new theory of music drama the author applies methodically to sundry opera traditions. However, this theory changes dramatically when Shaw addresses French authors, ranging from Leo Delibes, Jules Massenet and Georges Bizet to Charles Gounod. This essay examines how Shaw's vision of the genre changes after his development of the Life Force theory, which, in turn, compels the reader to reassess Shaw's understanding of the French opera tradition in the late 1880s and 1890s.

After all, Adorno explicitly echoes the verdicts of his intellectual forerunners, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Sigmund Freud, arguing that traditional theology is not restorable. Given the rejoinders that Adorno's phrasing has provoked from commentators such as Jacob Taubes and Giorgio Agamben, the present article proposes to re- evaluate the significance of Adorno's terminology with respect to two authors who colour his understanding of religion and theology: Franz Kafka and Walter Benjamin. In doing so, I aim to investigate the sense in which Adorno is able to mobilise the modern dislocation of traditional theology for a critique of reality under the rule of a capitalist cult religion. Die auffallige Pravalenz von theologischen Motiven in Adornos Werk ist wohl bekannt: von seiner wiederholten Bezugnahme auf das alttestamentarische Bilderverbot bis hin zu seinen Anfuhrungen eines messianischen Lichts. Diese terminologische Eigenart wirft eine schwierige Frage auf: Wie ist Adornos diesseitige Kritik der kapitalistischen Moderne mit seinem Rekurs auf religiose Termini zu vereinbaren? Schlie beta lich klingen bei Adorno die Urteile seiner intellektuellen Vorlaaufer, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche und Sigmund Freud nach, wenn er behauptet, traditionelle Theologie sei nicht wiederherstellbar. Mit Hinsicht auf die Ablehnung, welche Adornos Formulierungen bei Kritikern wie Jacob Taubes und Giorgio Agamben ausgelost hat, setzt sich der Beitrag zum Ziel, Adornos Sprachgebrauch im Hinblick auf zwei Autoren umzuwerten, die ma beta geblich sein Verstandnis von Religion und Theologie pragten: Franz Kafka und Walter Benjamin. Dadurch zielt der Beitrag zuletzt darauf ab, festzustellen, auf welche Weise Adorno die moderne Entstellung traditioneller Theologie dazu nutzt, um seine Kritik an der durch eine kapitalistische Kultreligion verzerrten Wirklichkeit zu formulieren.",42,"WOS:000398059400004",3

Romantic artistry, as such, rests on the spoken word: the sound of a word usually has priority over the letters that comprise it. Accordingly, Andersen's protagonist, the poet Antonio, tries to find a form of artistic self-expression which gives full weight to the living, breathing personality. Thus, we see Antonio's performances gradually having less and less in common with the conventions of public/dramatic readings, with their heavy reliance on textuality. More and more, his preferred direction is the exploitation of the possibilities inherent in the rhetoric of conversational language. All this seems to indicate that a Romanticism manifest in the symbiosis of poetry and music will be prone to see the secret of inspired art in its spontaneity, in the unrepeatable uniqueness of improvisation.",12,"WOS:000423253300001",3
"English",,,"The study of borrowed vocabulary and language contact in the Old English period is technically problematic in many ways. Surviving texts give us few clues as to how loans functioned outside the clerical communities, what their regional and register distributions were, and to what extent written sources reflect the circulation of loans in spoken language. This may suggest that a descriptive catalogue of lexical loans is the only approach applicable to the Old English material. This paper, however, aims at an inferential analysis of several loans from Latin and Greek in the religious and educational domain based on contemporary approaches to linguistic innovation, diffusion and change, and the wider cultural context that would have ensured their currency and dissemination - social networks provided by medieval schools and monasteries, and the ecclesiastical community at large. Using a select body of educated loans, it argues that strong ties within monastic communities would generally have prevented contact-induced lexical change from spreading outside the monasteries. Yet the role of individual innovators with both clerical and non-clerical ties and early adopters with elementary Latin proficiency (parish priests) in diffusion of change should not be underestimated.",48,"WOS:000422626100005",3

Previous studies suggest that dominant definitions of masculinity help to explain the importance of gender in this relationship. We analyzed data from the 2002 Education Longitudinal Study to assess the extent to which male students were bullied in connection with participation in cultural activities often perceived to lack masculinity. We found that participation in clubs/academic extracurricular activities were associated with increased odds of bullying victimization for male students. On the other hand, participation in music courses was associated with increased odds of victimization for all students.

He completed this linguistic and literary scope with the study of translations from English and the analysis of Slovak translations of Shakespeare. In the 1960s, he already formulated the conceptions of literary translation in the period of Slovak romanticism and in post-romantic poetry.

At the heart of this scholarship has been a preoccupation with the characters and their families, for these families play a prominent role in the texts: Gisli is outlawed for killing one brother-in-law to avenge another; Horr does not trust any of his male relatives, and this eventually leads to his downfall; and Grettir's difficult relationship with his father seems to lead to his reckless and arrogant behaviour later in life. But why are these stories about outlaw heroes so focussed on the relationships between the individual and his kin group? And why were Icelanders - medieval and modern so fascinated by these marginal, destructive figures? In this article these questions are addressed by approaching the outlaw from the perspective of monster theory. The monster, as a creature that points towards or even embodies meaning beyond itself, lends itself well to such an investigation into social and cultural concerns whose reflection we might see in the literary products of said culture. So far, outlaws have not been included into the corpus of Islendingasogur monsters, and therefore, the article consists of four parts. First, the concept of social monstrosity is established, based on Cohen's monster theory but more suited to the unique situation in the Islendingasiigur. This concept is then applied to the three major outlaws before turning to the discussion of outlaws within their matrix of family ties. In the final step, the monstrous outlaw in his disrupted, disruptive family will be read as symptomatic of medieval Icelandic socio-cultural concerns about the fragmentation of family structures.",60,"WOS:000419085500004",3

While Carew attempts an 'epic' translation conforming to the source text, creating a Gerusalemme conquistata-type of translation, Fairfax submits to the allure of Armida and to the romance of translator errancy.

An exception to the rule is the literary oeuvre of the largely unexplored Prague Russian emigre group ""Skit poetov"" (""A Hermitage of Poets"").

Although this appears a welcome suggestion to give ""new life"" to Comparative Literature, there are obstacles in the way of this ideal.

Instead, many of the traits for which the chicas raras suffered are now celebrated in Sanchez's protagonist. Likewise, the novel's other main character, Laura, at first appears to conform to the traditional heroines of the novela rosa, characterized by their stereotypical beauty, their willingness to submit to their families and male love interests, and their final goal of marriage.

Leaning on the association method applied both in the Western academic discourse and by the Moscow School of Ethnopsycholinguistics, we demonstrate how the author's (and the translators') individual verbal consciousness presumably influenced the creation (and the translation) of the text.",23,"WOS:000414980500015",3

Different configurations of contact situations, such as of creoles, interlects between standard languages and dialects, or even the emergence of Romance languages have been tried to be explained by ecolinguistic parameters, such as the rapidity of evolution or geographical distance. Contemporary urban vernaculars, i.e. the contact variety spoken in French peripheral urban districts, and the postcolonial contact in Maghrebine Francophony with Arabic varieties can be joined to the list of specific contact cases. The notion of ""limit"" can be considered an essential category in contact typology, and it turns out that Juri Lotman's semiotic approach can assign a specifically dynamizing function to the limits of language contacts. Under globalization conditions, even apparently very different outcomes of language contact can be explained by common underlying principles, even if we may accept the idea of a rupture in sociological terms.",46,"WOS:000414903500002",3
"English","Cortazar; Poetics; Politics; Fantastic; Short stories",,"The uneasy relationship between literary conception and political commitment is a recurrent subject of meditation in Julio Cortazar's writings and amongst his critics. The debate revolves around two main considerations: firstly, to what extent and how (if so) Cortazar managed to reconcile his aesthetic ideas with his ethical views; secondly, whether this reconciliation attempt meant a paradigm change in his poetics or not. These deliberations reached a culmination point and appeared in its most illuminating form in Cortazar's last three short story compilations; particularly in those stories where the need for political and ethical engagement articulates with the fantastic, one of the predominant narrative modes in his poetics. This article examines four of these short stories as prime examples of Cortazar's attempt to reconcile the individual metaphysical search typical of his early writings with his later political pledges. The hypothesis is that these stories actually represent an excellent instance of how he was able to achieve a harmonic symbiosis between his poetics and his politics in the last years of his life.",24,"WOS:000392292700007",3
"English","Nineteenth-century performances; Australian performances",,"The University of Melbourne's Baillieu Library holds an unrecorded and virtually unknown document related to Samuel Phelps' landmark production of Antony and Cleopatra (Sadler's Wells, 1849): a promptbook apparently marked up for a slated performance in Australia, bearing a half-title inscription that reads: ""R. W. Younge / Theatre Royal / Melbourne. Feby 1856"". Although there is no record of a performance having actually taken place, the promptbook offers a fascinating glimpse of how Phelps' extraordinarily successful English production - which is, remarkably, the earliest documented performance of Shakespeare's play rather than Dryden's adaptation - was considered for an overseas performance. It is especially valuable in that the promptbook for Phelps' original production is also still extant, meaning that we have both an original and a touring promptbook for the same nineteenth-century production of a Shakespeare play. When Antony and Cleopatra did eventually premiere in Australia in 1867 at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, it was Charles Calvert's much abbreviated version, following performances in Manchester and London. Younge's promptbook therefore represents not only a potential production in Australia over a decade before Antony and Cleopatra's true premiere there, but also an ambitious attempt to emulate the success of Phelps' earlier production in England.",41,"WOS:000396575400005",3

Particular emphasis is given to the analysis of the storylining techniques employed in the development of the arcs of Season 1 with a view to unpacking how, in turn, these determine mechanisms of the viewers' engagement with characters. As typical of much contemporary serial dramas, these are predominantly antiheroes and therefore our allegiance to them is questioned when problematic issues are raised, as in the case of violent actions and dubious moral choices.

The film and the 1997 video game based upon it take a novel set in San Francisco, the home of some of the first gay neighborhoods in the US that suffered from the crackdowns of the late 1970s and 1980s, and transplants this to Los Angeles, a city which glamorized decay, adding an aesthetic that draws on the look of New York, a city notoriously in economic decline in the 1970s.

Through a reading of Beckett's self-image and the treatment of photography in his work, one can provide a more unified view of Beckett the writer and of Beckett's image as a writer. Beckett's model was Proust, a writer who similarly favored photography. In many photographs, Beckett presented to viewers and readers an image unlike that promoted by his biographers or texts: aloof, reticent, recalcitrant and withdrawn. Frequently and directly, he faced the camera and, despite his pursuit of privacy and isolation, paradoxically provided a variety of photographers access to both his Paris apartment and Paris life.

"English",,,"The use of the ""born in the wrong body"" model of accounting for trans-gender embodiment pervades young adult fiction featuring transgender teenage girls, including the much-acclaimed Luna by Julie Anne Peters and Almost Perfect by Brian Katcher. Realistic novels about transgender teenagers, usually framed as ""coming of age"" narratives, privilege gender reassignment surgery as the culmination of a process of self-discovery confirming the gender binary. In wrong-body discourse, self-identity comes into conflict with and ultimately trumps the body, with the transgender character's transition following a single-minded trajectory to adulthood and the erasure of the transgender past. While this model of embodiment is undoubtedly accurate for some transgender teenagers, it limits the space in which to think about the complexity of gender for both cisgender and transgender readers. Two recent novels, Rachel Gold's Just Girls and Kristin Elizabeth Clark's Freakboy, serve to demonstrate both the persistence of wrong-body discourse and its disruption. A verse novel that allows a range of gender nonconforming characters to speak to their own experiences of embodiment, Freakboy offers readers alternatives to the wrong-body model.",31,"WOS:000413991100007",3

Within his own lifetime Balzac's popular novels were frequently adapted for the stage, and it follows that his highly visual style has also inspired film adaptations since the earliest advent of cinema. Generations of filmmakers have faced the dilemma of how to reflect the descriptive realism of Balzac's dense writing within the unique language of cinema. One of the more challenging and abstract features of Balzac's writing is the central importance of memory in many of his texts, among them Le Colonel Chabert (1834) and La Duchesse de Langeais (1836). In the wake of the antirealist movement in film (following its perceived association with mid-twentieth-century fascism), several recent film adaptations of Balzac have avoided the tendency to produce traditional, highly visual and illustrative interpretations of nineteenth-century realist prose by making original use of the presence or absence of diegetic sound in their films. In so doing, they grant a new realist importance to film audio and engage the viewer in the realist experience of a created and shared memory.",22,"WOS:000424104500002",3

There is historical near-consensus among editors that the Bastard means expediency or self-interest when he says ""commodity"". Karl Marx quotes these lines in an 1857 newspaper article in such a way that suggests that he reads the word ""commodity"" as denoting an article with exchange-value. A close reading of the Bastard's speech, an exploration of Shakespeare's use of the word in other plays and a survey of other early modern texts that use the word ""commodity"" provide evidence that Shakespeare means to denote the more modern economic sense of the word. If this is accepted, then the O.E.D. and future textual practice should be revised to incorporate this change.

In ""Uriah's War"", the final short story of the collection, Levy pursues her concern with the gaps in historical memory by revisiting the Great War at the significant historical time of the centennial anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict, in order to foreground the involvement of Caribbean colonial troops in the war effort. This article argues that ""Uriah's War"" forces readers to question the collective memory of the Great War as a white man's conflict, thus highlighting the fraught negotiations of memory and setting the historical record straight. It examines the ways in which ""Uriah's War"" addresses three major historical episodes of the Great War involving the British West Indies Regiment (BWIR), mostly unacknowledged or devalued in western historiography of the conflict. ""Uriah's War"" contributes to the rescue of Caribbean soldiers from historical oblivion and inscribes their voices in order to demonstrate their patriotic affiliation and denounce the racial discrimination suffered by soldiers of the BWIR during the Great War.",41,"WOS:000423345800002",3

Compared to many of his peers, not to mention younger poets, he hardly ever spoke on political matters; his poetry is even less concerned with politics. And yet, there is every reason to believe that the politics of his poetics is nothing short of revolutionary. This follows directly from Dragomoshchenko's conviction that language cannot be appropriated and that any claim to language is laughable by definition as it always proceeds through ""an idealistic repression of difference and desire in the name of law and equation"" ('Tam.

El Maleh found deep inspiration in Walter Benjamin's work on the ethical dimension of allegory as informed by kabbalistic notions of language.

While Hughes articulates a de-othering or entanglement with his surrounding space, Wright colludes in a historical process of racial differentiation of Spain and things Spanish.

Wright, Hughes's near contemporary and one-time co-author, provides an intriguing -if problematic -vision of Francoist Spain in his travelog Pagan Spain, published some twenty years after Hughes left the war-torn country in 1937.

In this essay I seek to bring the trilogy into conversation with a broader dialogue around reproduction in relation to race, drawing on discussions of scientific racism and medical apartheid. Butler's work draws on a variety of biopolitical discourses and is deeply concerned with the figure of the black woman as breeder, the history of reproduction as eugenics, and the contemporary ""tissue economies"" (Waldby and Mitchell) that continue to exploit the reproductive labor of non-white and third-world bodies. The XENOGENESIS trilogy illuminates the links between colonialism and biological capital, and uses apocalypse to show how the ""human"" is constantly being discursively and biologically reconstructed. By contrasting the genetic determinism of the Oankali with humans' insistence on biological and reproductive independence, Butler enacts a politics of ambivalence that situates reproduction as an ongoing dialectical process within the context of broader ecological systems. Although her work is certainly concerned with genetic engineering, she emphasizes the importance of generation rather than reproduction, articulating a theory of symbiogenesis that sees human evolution as reliant on dynamic relationships with other species and environments.",35,"WOS:000414380500005",3

The dramatic language of Racine provides a model of intellectual design that contrasts with the embroidered pattern of a tablecloth. A retrospective vision of rose-colored teacups on a tablecloth signifies Victorian decor, implicitly compared with a still life by Matisse (cover illustration).

Within the context of the nationalist movement in India, Bollywood cinema has played an important role in constructing various dichotomies such as tradition/modernity, Indian/Western and spiritual/material. By negotiating with these binaries, Bollywood narratives have contributed to the dialogue on women's roles and position in Indian society. In the past, Bollywood filmmakers were faithful to representations of women who were bound by patriarchal structures in the sense that they were expected to be loyal to ancient Indian traditions and belief-systems.

Probably this is due to their status as biographies of largely non-human subjects. Equipped with the insights of life-writing scholarship, including Paul de Man's argument that all autobiography is prosopopoeia and personification, it becomes possible to see the riddles' value as discourses on life progression and indeed as early examples of life-writing and 'object biography' in the English vernacular. Building on a consideration of the riddles alongside their Latin analogues as well as influential contemporary schemes of the life course, this paper advocates the interrogation of such critical labels as 'anthropomorphism' and 'personification', often applied to the riddles.

The article reviews the (often sparse) existing arguments on the matter and pushes these arguments further, taking into consideration such evidence as Anglo-Saxon naming conventions, the poem's treatment of marriages between feuding families, and our understanding of succession in the poem. It goes on to illustrate the ways in which this reading can shed light on some of the murkier diplomatic events of the poem in the complex relationship between the Geats and the Swedes, such as Onela's permitting Beowulf to become king of the Geats and Heardred's sheltering of Eadgils and Eanmund. The article also addresses the effect achieved by leaving this identity unstated in the poem, particularly for an audience to whom such an identification may not have been so difficult to make.",17,"WOS:000397575300008",3
"English","ontology; pain; suffering; transitivity; Wittgenstein",,"This article addresses the contentious philosophical claim that rhetoric is merely a ""philosophy without tears."" Mindful of the institutional and disciplinary stakes of this claim today, it offers a genealogy of ""philosophy without tears"" across the past century, from the popular ""no more tears"" genre to midcentury debates between ordinary language philosophers and logical atomists. What emerges is an ethical argument concerning the materiality and transitivity of language, fleshed out through a rhetoric of tears and as an ontology of pain and suffering. Drawing on a rhetorical reading of Wittgenstein's ""form-of-life,"" I argue that both pain and its expression should be understood as transitive rather than as epistemological or private phenomena. Transitivity helps us to better understand the perlocutionary power of pain and suffering in the politics of war and terrorism, in the ""manphilosopher,"" who disavows such transitivity, and, finally, in the necessary risk of responsibility toward the ""other"" of philosophy (and of rhetoric).",55,"WOS:000422848800010",3

To this end the essay explores the relationships between feelings and their linguistic expression as well as examining how emotions are represented in the memoir on the figurative level. In particular, the article looks at how idiomatic expressions, as part of the emotion lexis deployed in Joseph Anton, contribute to the emotional representation of its principal characters. The article claims that the memoir has an emotional structure imposed by a few central metaphors and sustained by idioms to figuratively frame its content. The study proves that Joseph Anton is not only heavily charged with emotions but it also utilizes a plethora of idiomatic expressions and figurative language, which is a distinctive feature of Rushdie's novelistic works.",52,"WOS:000412099400009",3
"English",,,"This article addresses the question of parasitism in Melville's short story ""Jimmy Rose"" (1855). Here, the narrator-William Ford-describes the sad fate of the title character, who was once rich, popular, and renowned for his lavish parties. Due to bad luck in business, he ends up having to live off his former admirers, from whom he earns free dinners through a combination of flattery and charm. As previous critics have noted, Jimmy Rose can thus be described as a parasite. However, whereas some scholars have also analyzed the narrator's unreliability, none have so far posed the question of whether he, too, has something of the parasite in him. A close reading of Ford's seemingly inconspicuous narrative strategies reveals him to embody aristocratic ideals wholly at odds with those of Jacksonian America. His aversion to labor and his corresponding fondness for idleness define him as an aristocratic remnant caught in a democratic present he despises. In addition, I argue that his narrative gives us sly hints that it is precisely through having parasitized the dying Jimmy Rose that he inherited the one thing that allows him to go on living an easy life of leisure: a habitat.",56,"WOS:000406763600003",3

The afterlives of Petrarch's texts contribute to understanding how translation can introduce novel material to a target culture which in turn transforms the literature in a new social and cultural context. These translations chart the spread of Petrarch's influence throughout Europe and illustrate how cultures absorb traditions through translations and reworkings. Although the Irish translations of Petrarch (into English) bear some similarities to the British translation tradition, the differences that are highlighted in this study illustrate how translation responds to differing cultural contexts even when dealing with the same linguistic group and time frame. This case study of translations of Petrarch's poetry in Ireland discusses the reach and influence of the Italian writer, while also examining the ability of translation to refashion the poet according to distinct local trends.",41,"WOS:000411430700001",3

The fact that Katharine Metcalfe became, in 1913, Mrs R. W.

The article proposes that Franz Kafka served as a point of mediation for Benjamin's changing formulations of tradition. The article then further suggests that Benjamin's work on tradition was structured by a fundamental tension between tradition and life outside tradition, i.e., tradition and life in exile. The article shows how, in the context of Benjamin's correspondence with Scholem, the tension of exile and tradition mirrored a growing personal and theoretical conflict between Scholem in Palestine and Benjamin in Europe. To examine the effects of the conceptual structure of tradition and exile on Benjamin's experience as an emigre, the article first addresses Benjamin's so-called Fichu dream from Nevers. In the suggested reading, the dream portrays Benjamin's vision of decay of tradition that informs his essays and letters on Kafka.",36,"WOS:000406532500004",3

Musa, the main character of the novel, reflects on and refracts his multiple lives through the prisms of hedonistic, nationalist, and Christological allegories. Allegories in Imbwa Yemunhu are meant to enable the protagonist to regain self-mastery, renegotiate the terms of his relationship to society, and arrest an inexorable descent into a life of depravity.

Printed in Naples in 1539, the poem is a mosaic of passages from the Gospels offering a synoptic version of the life of Christ. I argue that the Christiade represents not only a literary work, but also a tool for approaching the Gospels and for practicing domestic devotion. The Christiade could either be read in its entirety as a poem, or be perused as a handbook thanks to its paratextual apparatuses (glosse and tavole) which related passages in the poem to the Sunday Gospels. Readers could thus prepare themselves for Mass or meditate upon what they had heard at church. This article explores the Christiade within the context of contemporary Neapolitan culture, with special attention to print industry, book- trade, religious poetry and the questione della lingua.

Critics have argued over whether Jabra adequately connects his characters to ""reality"" on land. By attending to the Palestinian character Wadi.degrees s narrative in the novel, I argue that it is through this retreat from ""reality,"" or from realistic representations of Wadi.degrees s life in Palestine, that the novel shapes Palestinian exile as a dislocation in both time and space. Dreamlike memories and utopic fantasies of return mirror the structure of that other fantasy, of returning in historico-political time.

Yet colour is deployed and investigated in numerous distinctive and often painterly ways in her writing; ways which suggest her interest in other than racialized paradigms and which attune us to colour processing and human cognition, to emotional responses to colour, and to an ethical issue that is perpetually at stake in our engagement with her work: empathy. Through analysis of her colour-writing in selected texts, especially La Naufrag,e (1999), Rosie Carpe (2001), and Autoportrait en vert (2006), this article explores NDiaye's chromatic experimentation as a linchpin for asking probing questions about emotion, memory, the senses, perception, self-perception, creativity, and mental disorder in modern and contemporary writing in French.

"English","Plays for child performers; Drama education; Nature studies; Froebelian educators; Instructional drama",,"This article analyses plays written for child performers in the early twentieth century. The plays chosen are classified as ""instructional"" and aimed at developing pupils' knowledge of the curriculum. The focus is on understanding why these plays were useful for Froebelian educators in the period. Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852) was a German pedagogue, who is most widely known for establishing the kindergarten movement and for promoting child-centred learning. The use of instructional drama was appealing to many of his followers, as it chimed with their understanding of the need for experiential approaches to education. Nature study was particularly important to Froebel, and therefore this article evaluates instructional plays about the natural world, offering a close examination of five examples. They contain active, holistic and multi-sensory learning experiences which would have appealed to Froebelian teachers. They all use elements of anthropomorphism and some also use fairies to engage children with the subject matter. Such devices could be problematic in texts that were written for the purpose of teaching scientific realities and the representation of a human sensibility trapped in plant or animal form could sometimes result in emotionally distressing situations. However, the medium of drama gave children the power to make their own meaning from the material presented, perhaps through re-interpreting the plot with unscripted actions or through lightening the mood with a touch of humour. This was an advantage which the plays had over other forms of literature. These works merit increased respect as educational tools that supported innovative learning.",51,"WOS:000415213300004",3

Kaja Silverman's psychoanalytical semiotics, Vivian Sobchack's feminist phenomenological take on cinematic experience and Julia Kristeva's sujet en proces and revolutionary poetic language provide the theoretical background for a close reading of Sally Potter's film distinguished by a knowing, transmedial reaffirmation of third-wave, intersectional feminist theory, as well as modernist literary intertexts, particularly James Joyce's Ulysses.",30,"WOS:000415979000008",3

"English",,,"This article analyses the effects created by Lauren Beukes through her use of the cyberpunk genre in her first novel, Moxyland (2008). Because of its challenge to conventional ideas of embodiment and identity formation, together with its counter-cultural punk ethos, cyberpunk would seem to offer the prospect of transgressive versions of gender and sexuality. However, various critics note that instead of realising this potential, cyberpunk endorses heterosexual masculinity in its narratives, while repressing or marginalising the feminine and homosexual relations. In Moxyland, Beukes actively engages with the conventions of cyberpunk in order to subvert such reactionary reiterations and the conventional gendered power struc-tures that underpin them. Through techniques such as exaggeration, splitting and exploring contrasted forms of masculinity she criticises the cyberpunk genre's conventional treatment of gender, as well as the patriarchal power relations it promotes. Beukes also refutes cyberpunk's tendency to restrict the transgressive potential of its empowered female characters by portraying them in terms of sexualised femininity. She challenges essentialist notions of gender as she depicts women characters in active relation to technology. Her version of the female cyborg conveys a potentially transgressive blending of technology and biology, dramatised outside the conventional lens of the masculine gaze.",17,"WOS:000405334200004",3

This study focuses on Meerapfil's film's representation of post-World War II Argentina, the 1968 student movements in Europe, and (post)dictatorial Argentina as key moments in twentieth-century politics in which the film's characters must grapple with their own identities and political participation.

This study of Meerapfel's film reveals the interplays between liberation struggles and religious identities as too difficult a sociopolitical landscape to navigate, whereby the film's protagonists are only finally able to relate to each other by detaching themselves from the historical weight of these tensions that continue to go unresolved.",41,"WOS:000397554400006",3

Set in an unidentifiable Spanish locus and time, the novel portrays a dystopian world bereft of hope for a young boy and an elderly shepherd who flee through the desert from a repressive local sheriff. Carrasco's highly allegorical work presents the plight of the boy who continually negotiates the open moral ground symbolized by the imposing wasteland throughout the text. My study highlights the ways in which demonic archetypes outlined by Northrop Frye, as well as writings by Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Henri Lefebvre on space and nomadology, inform Carrasco's narrative vision. The smooth space of the intermezzo, a world ""in-between,"" stands apart from the strictures of striated space and serves as the backdrop for Intemperie. I conclude that Carrasco fashions a wasteland freighted with disorder and injustice.",19,"WOS:000415646700004",3

By contrasting these two authors, I show the difficulty that feminist thinkers had in forging an Enlightenment appreciation for the Islamic world and a critique of Islamic slave institutions at the same time. The ways in which Aubin and Montagu deploy pro- and anti-Islamic sentiments in combination with varying levels of attention to the psycho-sexual trauma of female enslavement in the Ottoman world is emblematic of larger trends in the period. An understanding of this dynamic can help us to think more clearly about how we have inherited these tensions in our own scholarly work on feminism, slavery, and the English encounter with the Ottoman world.",43,"WOS:000404040100003",3

This revolutionary autobiography is experimental in both form and content, containing poems, stories, journals, reportage and so forth.

The voices of mother and daughter fuse into one, together with the voices of all their ancestors.

Pasolini originally intended to publish his sketches in a comic book that, in the end, he did not complete. These drawings eschew any clear-cut definition. They are an attempt at a comic book, but they also visualize Pasolini's screenplay so closely that they could be the film's storyboard. Whether they are functional to the film or conceived to tell the same story in a different medium, these drawings represent a residual text that sheds light on Pasolini's conversion to the figurative arts. His hand-drawn images investigate the function of colour, while exemplifying Pasolini's observations on linguistic contamination, the merging of high-and lowbrow expressive forms, free indirect style and the new literary monstra represented by hybrid narrative structures.",29,"WOS:000411424800007",3

I argue that Harabat - compiles texts from diverse geographical and temporal origins and, instead of defining them as members of distinct national traditions, projects this - compilation as what I call a literary ""reservoir"" that constitutes the multilingual Ottoman canon. My argument draws upon Ziya Pasha's characterization of the Ottoman culture as an ""ocean"" that encompasses Arabic, Persian, and Turkish ""streams."" This description undermines the typical scholarly view that the Ottoman culture emerged and developed under Arabic and Persian influences. I then reframe our understanding of canonization through using the conceptual repertoire that the world literature scholarship has brought into literary studies-circulations, target culture, and source culture. Building upon John Guillory's work on the process of canon formation, I propose that each source text can be ""deracinated"" when its context is ignored in the target culture to facilitate this text's incorporation into a new canon, or ""reservoir."" This article finally calls for rewriting the history of comparative and world literature by demonstrating that Harabat is constitutive of the nineteenth-century comparative literature paradigm.",35,"WOS:000422844400003",3
"English","D'Annunzio; ekphrasis; Notturno; Titian; Venice","IMAGE","This article analyzes the relationships between literature and the arts in D'Annunzio's Notturno. The verbal and the visual constantly intersect in the poet's corpus. Nevertheless, the Notturno is unique: according to the narrator, he composes the text during a period of semi-blindness caused by a war-related accident. Consequently, the protagonist is unable to see his favorite works of art, which are described through the filters of memory, desire, and imagination. D'Annunzio's nocturnal ekphrasis blends wake and dream, asceticism and eroticism, narrative linearity and poetical fragmentation. Vision and writing deconstruct their own conventional separations: the elements of each form mingle in a dimension that reflects simultaneously the influence of the Decadent age and the birth of Modernism. Despite the scarce scholarly attention devoted to the Notturno outside the borders of Italy, D'Annunzio's text anticipates the current debates on the aporias of sight (Derrida), the ambiguous temporality of the visual arts (Didi-Huberman), and the contradictory distinction between internal' and external' vision (Belting).",46,"WOS:000405077300003",3

It shows how Seiler's novel adopts the narrative structure of the robinsonade to test the small utopia of an alternative existence within the borders of the GDR shortly before the fall of the Berlin wall. The island of Hiddensee is depicted in the novel as a sort of GDR-Tahiti for GDR social drop-outs who are engaging in a 'Zeitspiel' in opposition to the mainland at the very moment when the events of 1989 produced massive geo-political upheavals. The continual use of literary citation underpins the chronopoetic game of Seiler's protagonists who, by fictionalising their world, attempt, at least temporarily, to flee the bleakness of their lived socialist realities. Enacting Eigenzeit through the mode of fiction, the novel replaces the big political utopia with the small utopia.

I reproduce Bigg's account in its entirety because, to date, Artificial Limbs has not been digitised, although it is held at around a dozen academic libraries in the UK and USA respectively. Bringing attention to and providing a close reading of a source not previously discussed academically sheds new light on the way the disabled body was read by medical professionals in the second half of the nineteenth century. In addition, I consider Bigg's narrative rendering of this unique case study alongside several contemporary sources, including memoirs, novels, short stories, and journal articles. In doing so, I identify how assumptions made by Bigg about the (disabled, female, privileged) hand mirror and echo those in the wider cultural sphere. The sensing hand is an instrument of will, and the creation of such a prosthesis troubles the dynamics of active and passive, touching and touched that Pamela K. Gilbert has identified as crucial to nineteenth-century discourses surrounding the hand. By designing and making this prosthesis, Bigg exerts his professional and masculine agency to make the woman's body assume the position of something beheld rather than embodied.",47,"WOS:000395430200001",3

Through a close reading of the text, I endeavor to show how the novel parodies Enter the Dragon, the most famous of Bruce Lee's films. In this way, the narrator imagines an alternative biography of her father, as if he never voluntarily left her for another family, but rather was forced by the dictatorship to abandon her. The narrator's memories do not distinguish between reality and imagination as she creates a fantasy in the form of bruceploitation films, in which her father fought like a martial arts star against the greatest enemies of the Chilean dictatorship. Thus, irony and parody allow us to understand how martial arts films of the 1970s can be used to elaborate both a private and a political mourning.",31,"WOS:000396550300004",3

"English","aesthetics; Faust; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; Naturphilosophie; ontology; Friedrich Schelling",,"This article approaches the concept of the absolute operative in Goethe's Faust by taking its point of departure from Schelling's Naturphilosophie, which supersedes and embeds tragic subjectivity in an ontological dynamic that both grounds and exceeds the subjective. The essential operations of such an absolute manifest themselves in the tensions and inconsistencies generated by dynamic forcesattraction and repulsion, contraction and expansionthat move through all appearances, whether material, psychic, or discursive. Because a chaotic reserve of disorder belongs intrinsically to the unfolding of the absolute of Naturphilosophie, absolute signification in Faust manifests itself primarily in the shape of aberrant destinies. Moreover, the transcendental and textual dynamics of attraction and repulsion produce operations of unconditioning (from the conditionlessness of the absolute, das Unbedingte) such that no singular phenomenon or individuated being can become a prioritized representative of the absolute. This article thus attempts to uncondition Faustian striving by drawing attention to alternative models of absolute signification in the textfor example, to Homunculus (the absolute as disindividuation), Euphorion (hyperindividuation), Gretchen (heteronomous-ethical individuation), or Mephistopheles (the negation of individuation)each of whom are differentiated but nevertheless share the dynamic of forces of attraction and repulsion through which the movement of the absolute discloses itself. Finally, the paper seeks to uncondition the Eternal Feminineitself an inconsistent, queer manifestation of the absolute (since it operates not just on male subjects, but on female subjects and angels that perturb sexual differentiation)and open the path to an exteriority to the narrative of redemption, one that calls into question the Eternal Feminine as a full, adequate representation of the textual cosmology of Faust.",23,"WOS:000416860100005",3

Both authors stress the value of moral shame for reforming South Africa's society and focus on the body in their literary representations of shame. Country of My Skull describes how Krog's body resonates with the pain of the victims when it shows physical symptoms of shame and guilt. Wicomb's novel David's Story, on the other hand, pictures the coloured body as a site of shame concerning the coloureds' ancestral origins. The majority of coloureds ought to shed this unnecessary shame, Wicomb's novel suggests, while those who were complicit with apartheid should acknowledge it as moral shame. Both texts complicate the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'s differentiation between legally verified forensic truth and narrative truth that allowed the victims to privilege the particularities of their individual experience. Country of My Skull suggests that the TRC hearings relied on a dynamic of narrative transference and substitution that made the voicing of shame and guilt possible in the first place. David's Story suggests that the distinction between forensic truth and narrative truth obscures the fact that the hearings enabled perpetrators to suppress the truth and avoid legal punishment.",33,"WOS:000417631400006",3
"English","Climate change; US South; planetary; cultural memory; Barbara Kingsolver",,"This article argues that Barbara Kinsolver's novel Flight Behaviour (2012) responds to the transformations of climate change by charting interactions between local and planetary environments, prompting readers to contextualise the micro - geographically bounded human experience and memory - within the macro context of the Anthropocene. As a long-standing process in the past, present and future, climate change requires epistemological frames attuned to complex scales of time and place which are central to this special issue's interest in planetary memory. In accordance with these dynamics, the novel suggests a definition of planetary memory in which remembrance is both human (and global) as well as more-than-human (exceeding the global, moving to the planetary). The novel is also explicitly concerned with imagining (or re-membering) the future as much as the past and present. Echoing the dynamics of the novel itself, the article works from the ground up, beginning with a consideration of the environmental contexts of Tennessee, Appalachia and the South, before moving to a wider sense of the planetary.

Saura and his co-screenwriter used the French authors Theophile Gautier and Prosper Merimee in their research on the period, thus incorporating views of Spain emanating from the culture of the Napoleonic aggressor. This, combined with the fact that the incorporation of outlaws into militia resistance was a common feature of the Napoleonic wars, produces a very complex backdrop for the film.

His condensed and crystallized deployment of classic Chaucerian themes such as the circle, the maze, and the echo gives us a sharp sense of Chaucer's tragic reading of history.

While Giorgio Aurispa aspires to follow the teachings of Nietzsche and affirm life, his psychological weakness and sick will render him unable to do this. Any energy and willpower that Giorgio does possess is channelled into a morbid direction, alienating him from life and those around him. Giorgio becomes fixated on the beautiful' deaths of several figures (including Percy Bysshe Shelley and his uncle, who committed suicide) and, rather than imitating Zarathustra's affirmative attitude towards life, aspires to create an end for himself that matches the beauty of the deaths of these macabre role models. It is Wagner's Tristan and Isolde that provides the most beautiful - and fatal - model for death, however, and after hearing Wagner's music D'Annunzio's protagonist becomes obsessed with recreating a Liebestod.

Integrating force dynamics into the ecocritical agenda can serve as a means to move beyond anthropocentrism, as well as the binarised assumption that there exists an environmental intrinsicality, by shifting the focus of attention to relational interfaces. Resistance to or exertion of physical force is, in many instances of Scott's work, an instantiation of hierarchicalised relationships between human and non-human animals or categories of the human. Analysis of the light-horseman trope frames the examination of force dynamics in the representation of a horse, a dog and birds in The Lay. Comparative analyses of selected scenes representing non-human animals in The Lady of the Lake (1810), Waverley (1814) and The Black Dwarf (1816) suggest continuities and changes in Scott's representation of the non-human animal in subsequent years.",60,"WOS:000399573300005",3

Extending Walter Benjamin's notion that the photographic image uniquely constellates the past and the present - of which ""seeing and then seeing again"" is therefore a form - I show that through his depiction of visual culture, Vladislavic engages critically with South African history in the present, and, consequently, his own historical position as white and thus always already a beneficiary of the apartheid regime. From this, I go on to argue that the method of ""seeing and then seeing again"" inverts the genre of Euroimperial travel writing theorized by Mary Louise Pratt in Imperial Eyes to lay bare questions of scopic power, including Vlad's own.",29,"WOS:000397221300004",3

Onions stresses the economic and psychological cost to his protagonist, Oleron, of remaining true to his artistic conscience in an increasingly commercial publishing environment. I consider shifting ideas about gender roles that include the promotion of an imperial' masculinity of a type antithetical to the artistic identity. I also explore Oleron's attitude towards an admirer, a New Woman-type journalist and contrast her with a spectral femme fatale who represents for him a muse from an earlier time. This belief in the ghost leads to a breakdown which I frame in terms of Edwardian models of manliness and hysteria.

As the unnamed narrator struggles in an inhospitable city, he internalizes this unflinching feeling of estrangement through introjection. This process reveals how the loss of home entails the state of a vagabond who resists normalization and seeks the unruly life of the underground. The way the city of Montreal is portrayed as notorious for its indifference towards newcomers aggravates the condition of the divided self in exile, which necessitates the intrusion of the monstrous. In effect, not only does introjecting the cockroach signify a menacing presence but also suggests a decolonizing act of insubordination against a city whose hegemonic order, like its freezing weather, looms large.",30,"WOS:000397221300012",3
"English","agency; John McLeod; psychoanalysis; race; resistance; Saba Mahmood; Sam Selvon; sexuality; Slavoj Ziek; space",,"This article argues that theoretical notions of resistance and agency prove inadequate for considering the complexities of the treatment of Sam Selvon's Trinidadian characters. Indeed, to proceed from a binary logic of resistance and oppression carries the danger of universalizing those seen as oppressed, and smoothing over important complications in the novel. The Lonely Londoners, written at a pivotal moment of imperial decline, offers a valuable perspective on the experience of colonial immigration to England (and the accompanying complications of race and sexuality it wrought) as well as theories of resistance. By drawing on the circumspection of recent theorists, this article goes beyond the sort of analysis which might impose a binary logic of resistance and oppression on the complex intersections of race and sexuality on display in the novel. More specifically, The Lonely Londoners can be seen as grappling with and critiquing individualism, one of liberalism's chief values; formally, the novel's title invokes a group yet the narrative itself spends the majority of its pages detailing the individual lives of its characters, individual lives which stand in tension with their shared group identity and their daily struggles in postwar London. This tension between individualism and community reveals key moments such as one character's personification of the colour black as being symptomatic of a complex field of identity categories that Selvon's novel engages with. I argue that these categories should indeed be interrogated alongside the novel's depictions of metropolitan geography; however, I suggest that such an analysis is best served by also treating a key concept that might be taken for granted with the same complexity and diligence: resistance.",22,"WOS:000402915400010",3

Criticism has avoided exploring the interplay between stylistic choices and political dimensions in her poetry, which includes engagements with pressing environmental issues today (global warming, rising seas, and chaotic weather), preemptive wars, and questions of plausible poetic agency itself. Foregrounding a material dimension while still maintaining a sense of responsibility, this essay highlights Alain Badiou's use of poetic configurations as ""subjects"" engaging in ethical world-recognitions that help situate an important underlying posthuman ethos evident in Graham's poetry. Barad, in a discourse with roots in quantum physics, argues that we must rethink representation from an entirely different phenomenology of intra-actions, beginning with relations, not objects or Cartesian selves. Thus both Badiou and Barad, in radically different but complementary ways, situate ontological finites-poems and sites of intra-action-as means of overcoming Derridean diff,rance, which remains one formal cornerstone of postmodern displacement evident in American mass media's post-truth equalization of all positions without situating possibilities of coherent analysis or engagement.

The article examines a set of novels written by Pietro Chiari (1712-1785) that makes use of such title references. In the early stages of his novel production, Chiari mobilised French and British novel titles in an appropriation of these novelistic traditions. The Brescian writer then gradually abandoned the project of appropriation and began to reference only his own titles.

Appealing to the emotions in sacred rhetoric was not a strategy opposed to reasoned argument (as it often figures in secular rhetoric); rather, feelings of love for God and sympathy for one's fellow Christians were among the virtues that preachers sought to rouse in their hearers. Nor were the emotions and the reason rigidly separated in homiletic theories; the preacher persuaded through argument, rhetorical figures and the vehemence that his own spiritual conviction created. These links between argument, example and affection in persuasion are best demonstrated in the exhortation, which uses all the resources that the preacher had at his disposal to move his hearers towards godliness. One of the most significant means of persuasion was for the preacher to create a sympathetic bond between himself and the hearers. He addressed them as thinking and feeling members of a Church in which they all shared an interest.

Unlike Bombay's novels, which have been read as an allegory of the city at large, its poems offer an alternative perspective, presenting Bombay as a space of intimate experiences, social interactions and fleeting impressions.

In making capital of Walter Benjamin's essay, Theses on the Philosophy of History' (1950), the article will read both literary city and nation in terms of Michael Titlestad's conceptualization of the mezzanine ontology' (2010) as a descriptor of the condition of post-apartheid liminality.",20,"WOS:000425102700005",3
"English","Pedagogy; learning; Mara and Dann; Doris Lessing; Paulo Freire; Sufism",,"This article considers pedagogy as a consistent theme in Doris Lessing's fiction. It draws on a deleted prefatory note in the typescript to Mara and Dann, which states that the heroine is consumed with a passion to learn and go to school. The article explores how Mara learns in a reimagined Africa after a future ice age. In the absence of formal schooling, a game is used in which children are asked repeatedly, What did you see? This game is compared to Henry James's use of a child's perspective in What Maisie Knew, to strategies for unveiling and naming the world in Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed, and to ideas about teaching in Idries Shah's The Sufis and Learning How to Learn. The article thus argues that radical and anticolonial approaches to learning are figured in Lessing's fiction, and in her Nobel lecture, as essential for human survival.",25,"WOS:000400008800010",3
"English","Ibsen; independent theatre; London; transnationalism; translation","HISTORY","This article considers the British reception of Ibsen around the turn of the century, replacing modernism's strongly teleological sense of its own temporality with a more spatially inflected account of artistic production that draws on tropes such as 'the Republic of Letters', 'Weltliteratur' or recent interest in 'Global Ibsen'. In particular, it examines the independent theatre movement as an exemplary instance of a transnational space operating outside of national canons and histories, and dependent on the involvement of a large number of individuals whose linguistic and cultural allegiances resist ready definition. It views the contexts of British Ibsen reception around 1900 not from the point of view of their eventual outcome (either in the institutional history of British theatre, or in the story of Ibsen's eventual place in the literary canon), but as a way of rethinking the interaction between the local, national and international in literary analysis and history.",37,"WOS:000405895300009",3
"English","Mappaemundi; Maps; Ecomimesis; Romanticism; Embeddedness",,"This article considers the extent to which medieval mappaemundi are an important precedent for literary cartographies in fiction for children. It connects the notion of embeddedness to Peta Mitchell's (2011) suggestion that mappaemundi refused to entertain the later, post-Enlightenment cartographic distinction between subject and environment, positing instead the ""absorption'' of the medieval subject into the religious medieval world space. The article documents some of the visual conventions that maps in children's literature have appropriated from mappaemundi. In doing so, it articulates the contradictions inherent both to ecological rhetoric and cartographic space and the visual lexicon of maps included with children's books, which contribute to a rhetoric of ecomimesis. The article argues that maps in children's literature are invested in a rhetoric of ecomimesis, that we are, as Timothy Morton (2009) has it, ""embedded'' in Nature, and that this embeddedness conceit threatens to forestall critique in that it reproduces the related oppositions of culture/Nature, subject/object and subject/environment even as it appears to collapse their respective terms. In the process, it considers maps in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (2007/1719), the Alderley Edge books of Alan Garner, Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons (2012/1930), and Rosemary Sutcliff's Outcast (1998/1955).",46,"WOS:000394961600007",3

It suggests that although Chaucer relies primarily on Ovid's Fasti for the language and structure of Lucretia's story, he builds into his legend a sustained response to Livy and Augustine's writings on Lucretia as well.

"English","Leroux; Podalydes; Poe; adaptation; Yellow Room; newspaper",,"This article considers the most recent film adaptation of Gaston Leroux's Le mystere de la chambre jaune, the 2003 version directed by Bruno Podalydes, as a production which 'palimpsestuously' brings out the self-reflexive qualities of the original text. Leroux's detective novel can be seen, intertextually, as a series of embedded narratives, symbolized by the enclosed walls of the locked Yellow Room itself. Focus falls in particular on the representation of newspapers in the novel, an echo of practices at work in Poe's early detective stories, which cut and paste newspaper reports as fictionalized source texts. As in Poe's tales, such texts are challenged and pastiched by the broader narrative of the novel. Podalydes' film incorporates its own embedded narratives via the inclusion of newspapers, photography and theatre, and accentuates the ludic quality of Leroux's text through the frequent images of toys and gadgets which give visual significance to cogs and levers, making manifest the workings of the contraptions as Leroux exposes the workings of narrative in his mystery novel. This article will examine Podalydes' embracing of the self-awareness of its source text and the way it playfully points to multiple points of origin.",15,"WOS:000424104500003",3
"English","colonial paternalism; Oedipus complex; psychoanalysis; racial discourses; Shaun Johnson; Sigmund Freud; South Africa; South African literature; The Native Commissioner; Union of South Africa",,"This article considers the prevalence and dynamics of colonial paternalism and oedipal typicality as they operate within Shaun Johnson's novel, The Native Commissioner (2006). Therefore, the article explicates how Freud's oedipal theory can, read within its historical context, contribute and serve as a tool to elucidate colonial discourses. It also indicates the prevalence of colonial paternalism, not merely through the South African Union government (1910-1961) and apartheid, but as I will argue, within post-apartheid South Africa. Johnson's novel, which presents a father-son narrative, interfaces with colonial paternalism through the father, George Jameson, and his role as a Native Commissioner. Through an analysis of the ideological assumptions underlying George's identity as a father (and associated notions of husbandry, gardening, and cultivation), the shared ideological basis of his career as a Native Commissioner and his seemingly neutral role as a patriarch is highlighted. The article then considers how oedipal dynamics structure the novel's focus on paternalism. Through an analysis of George's failure as a patriarch and the psychically invested nature of the narrative, we encounter the concomitant anxiety of the son-as-narrator. This anxiety manifests itself in the oedipal mechanics of castration anxiety, rivalry, and identification as originally explicated by Freud. Through these mechanics, the power of the son-as-narrator is emphasized as the father dies and the son identifies with the father's power. The remainder of the article re-contextualizes these findings within the novel's reception by South African audiences. The novel's popularity suggests that colonial paternalism remains a discourse that still has significant purchase for white South Africans even amid calls to identities based on equality and multiculturalism.",34,"WOS:000402915400004",3

The voyeuristic gaze of the main protagonist, Andrea, renders an intimate and sustained portrait of the inversion of gender roles in a postwar marriage in which the wife, Gloria, is the breadwinner and the husband, Juan, is both traumatized and poverty-stricken. My analysis is three-fold, centring primarily on Juan's inadequate masculinity, Gloria's economic power and her forms of resistance. My article reconceives Laforet's treatment of gender by illuminating the under-studied categories of the traumatized male and the working woman in the postwar period. This article will also consider Laforet's investment in this reconstruction of postwar gender archetypes, seeking to ascertain whether the representation of Gloria and Juan is a critical response to, and undoing of, prejudicial social and gendered practices, or whether remnants of those very same biases underlie this representation.",54,"WOS:000413548900005",3

The ways in which Bossewell uses the Legend in dialogue with the Wife of Bath's Tale and the Book of the Duchess serve, at least superficially, to promote a subordinated, passive model of femininity that works as an enhancing foil for chivalric English masculinity.

"English","King John; Richard III; Hamlet; architecture; privacy; sovereignty",,"This article considers the ways in which Shakespeare used the theatre's representative space to explore the possible uses and misuses of the Renaissance privy closet by royal figures in King John, Richard III and Hamlet. While scholars have typically figured the closet as a space for licensed misbehaviour for monarchs, Shakespeare repeatedly portrays the king retreating to his closet in moments of dramatic crisis, enacting an abnegation of his public duties. Ironically, what the behaviour of these sovereign figures demonstrates is that Hamlet, who in the closet scene brazenly accuses his mother of incest and murders the wrong man, actually has a better understanding of the royal closet's function, because he enters the closet by invitation, limits slanderous accusations to the most private of spaces, and defends the room from interlopers. I use the closet in order to interrogate how specific spaces make new types of behaviour possible, and how occupants must negotiate the correct uses of these spaces. It is only from inside that the sovereign's time in the closet space appears justified; from outside the closet, the audience will tend to perceive concealment.",26,"WOS:000405720800004",3

Surveying most of Laenen's published work, the discussion identifies three recurring narrative tropes and several paratextual elements that can be read as attempts to seduce young male readers into a receptive attitude towards intergenerational intimacies. However, the article also acknowledges that such a reading might obscure the reasons why young readers were attracted to Laenen's work, which would impoverish our understanding of the books' complex seductive appeal.",40,"WOS:000416050600002",3
"English","Hong Kong; press censorship; rule of law; colonialism and law; law and history",,"This article constitutes the first in-depth study of press censorship in British Hong Kong during the first century of colonial rule. By revealing how the press, the Chinese press in particular, was continuously and systematically monitored and pervasively censored through the collaborative efforts of executive actions, legislative provisions and judicial decisions, this article further posits that the common law system practiced in British Hong Kong during the period under study was complicit in the imposition of an authoritarian form of law and order, and was more interested in preserving the British Empire's overseas territorial and economic possessions and managing the power equation in the region than in safeguarding individual liberties in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is often praised for its rule-of-law colonial legacy, but this article argues that such narrative does not stand up to the scrutiny of archival study. The English law in Hong Kong history, rather than constituting a lens through which one can witness Hong Kong's quest for modernity, is more akin to a mirror reflecting an ongoing cycle of coercion and resistance through law. Drawing on unexplored archival sources, the article first discusses how the colonial government used libel lawsuits to punish the press for criticism of the government in the 19th century, before turning to describing in detail the daily mandatory vetting of Chinese newspapers by colonial censors under the office of the Secretary for Chinese Affairs and related prosecution cases in the early 20th century.

This promise, education as a gift of freedom, fails it fails to speak to students today, fails to remedy racial and gendered disparities, and fails by giving students tests to pass that fail to make them think.

It analyses the sometimes contradictory strategies by which these authors denounce the penal systems in which they were incarcerated. As an adjunct to these established 'vectors' of gender, race and class which inevitably shape and are expressed through these texts, I add the idea of the prison itself. Ultimately I show that the way in which these texts base their critique of the oppressive hegemonic institution of the prison on an appeal to the oppressive institutions of race and gender means that their critiques can only ever be partial. The point is not to condemn the shortcomings of these authors but rather to affirm the need for an intersectional approach to oppressive institutions.",43,"WOS:000413346800007",3

In order to study the traffic from the fictional to the everyday in narrative means of mind representation, we identify signposts of fictionality in a life story interview and analyze how they function in a nonfictional environment. The article introduces the term cross-fictionality to characterize a narrative where the frame of reference is nonfictional but the narrative modes include those that are conventionally regarded as fictional. We demonstrate that modes of mind representation characteristic of fiction travel to other narrative environments also outside the artistic sphere. Our results indicate that further research is needed regarding the interpretative effects of these narrative features that have mostly been analyzed in literary fiction so far. As fictionality is a question of quality and not of genre, it needs to be studied by using theoretical-methodological frameworks that are sensitive to the semiotic factors of narrative, and not confined to authorial intentions or to the ontological status of the subject matter.",31,"WOS:000415658300007",3

Focusing upon Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things, the article proposes a theoretical framework for interrogating the forms of priming, bias, and insight gained via these physical dimensions of reading. In particular, it examines a narrative technique termed ""embodied anchors,"" by which Roy conveys her characters' experiences and their interpretations of those experiences through image clusters that function both as metaphors and as physical cues, simultaneously affecting both ""basic"" and ""moral"" emotions (as differentiated by the clinical psychologists Bunmi 0. Olatunji and Jorge Moll). The article analyzes how these embodied prompts activate readers' preconscious modes of perception, modify cognitive skills, and intensify the effects of reading by anchoring ideational content in readers' bodies, rendering abstract concepts physically tangible, thus providing alternative and parallel means of communicating and manipulating knowledge. This knowledge, it is argued, can be integrated into readers' range of experiences in ways that parallel ""real-life"" encounters, potentially facilitating profound learning.",46,"WOS:000403740400004",3

This allows the viewer to perceive surveillance as part of the subject matter of the story and as inseparable from its narrative structure.

"English","visualization; vivid images; reading experience; mental imagery","PICTURES; OBJECT","This article deals with the phenomenology of reading narrative fictions, in particular with the production of mental imagery in the process of reading. Because readers differ in their capacities to visualize, this article proposes a distinction between default visualization and vivid images, a difference experienced by readers regardless of whether they are prone to more or less visual imagining. It argues that the default mode of visualisation is unlike actual perception. It is indistinct, transient, and lacking in saturation and memorability, since it relies on cultural schemata and prototypes for efficient processing of the text. These indeterminacies do not, however, disturb readers or cause dissonance. Rather, they are advantageous, as they allow the constant accommodation of new incoming facts. In contrast to what is assumed by traditional reader response theories, gaps left in default visualization do not for the most part need filling in. At certain stages in the reading process, however, narrative texts do trigger a kind of vivid imagery that is akin to actual perception. Based on recent neuroscientific experiments, this article suggests that these highlighted and especially vivid images occur when fictional acts of seeing force readers to shift from action-oriented visualisation to object visualization. Some pertinent examples of these close-up, focali7ed descriptions of perception are discussed, which encourage substituting the automatic default mode with a more conscious and focused object visualization.",48,"WOS:000403740400003",3
"English","dramatic tone; poetic justice; adaptation; cinematic endings; moral emotions; narrative structure",,"This article delves into the topic of the central emotion within a screenplay, and the extent to which it can grant the work coherence. It will demonstrate that the emotional core of the story consists in the profound, extended emotion that stems directly from its main theme. It will make these arguments by analysing the screenplay for Julian Schnabel's The Diving bell and the Butterfly (2007), the screen adaptation of Jean-Dominique Bauby's memoir regarding his experience of 'locked-in' syndrome. As Ronald Harwood's screenplay changes the thematic focus of the original novel, comparing the two texts reveals how different themes invoke different fundamental emotions. The article, drawing especially on the narrative theory developed in the screenwriting textbooks by Robert McKee (1997) and John Truby (2007), elaborates on an issue that has been ignored by other analyses of the movie: from the open-ended story of self-reflection that is told in the book, Harwood gets a close-ended story of rebirth. The article highlights how the tension towards the protagonist's internal goal determines the emotional nucleus of the plot. It also suggests that the emotional core is informed by 'dramatic tone' and argues that it consists in the 'desire of justice' regarding the main character's destiny.",26,"WOS:000399015700006",3

When considering the play's representation of commerce, seduction and religion abroad, at stake is something closer to rhetorical considerations at home; that is, how to convert foreign ornamentation to advantage.

It attempts to explain why the public would support lustration laws and/or engage in gossip stemming from the files, despite knowing their shortcomings. After briefly summarizing the long process by which agreement was reached concerning the Polish lustration bill, and describing some of the unique qualities of Polish lustration, the article presents arguments for why the formerly secret police files might be popularly accepted as the foundation used for the judicial process. The main justification discussed is found in literary and scholarly attempts to read the files biographically and to use them as inspiration for new biographies. The article shows that scholarly queries into secret police files as historically useful sources coincide with Polish popular interest in non-fiction literature and memoirs. I propose that fitting the police files within the already popular genre of biography offers entertainment value, while at the same time offering the documents legitimacy. This article shows that whereas scholars and authors of popular memoirs treat the files within a range of possibilities, the lustration process has room only for a straight forward reading of a file as a truthful story about an individual.",41,"WOS:000413977500005",3

However, Riddle 48 should be analysed in its own right, especially given evidence from the medical tradition that prescribes writing on patens and performing psalms and other prayers over them in order to cure sickness.

"English","Decadence; Degeneration; Stigma; 1905 Revolution; Satirical Journals; Medical Discourse",,"This article discusses how some Russian satirical journals capitalized on the medical discourse of degeneration shortly after the 1905 Revolution in order to stigmatize certain decadent literary figures as degenerate purveyors of social unrest. This is not an exhaustive examination of the role of satirical journals in this process, but an indicator that the scientific discourse of degeneration was not limited to medical journals, academic lectures and literary salons. Along with this medical discourse, the designation ""decadent"" became an abusive moniker that was used to stigmatize the writer as a deviant and degenerate psychopath. This article suggests that as a result, medical theory played a more important role in shaping the popular discourse of the Russian fin de siecle than has been previously discussed. In fact, this stigmatizing discourse was quite prevalent, by which criticism of literary decadence was intertwined with the medical pathology of degeneration. Russian satirical journals played a role in this process by popularizing this medical discourse for readers, combining the latest theories on degeneration with sensational accounts of alcoholics, drug addicts and syphilitics, while at the same time depicting modernists as morally corrupt transmitters of social and political discontent.",41,"WOS:000413889800003",3

"English","Max von Oppenheim; Orientalism; photography; visual culture; costume",,"This article discusses Max von Oppenheim's Orientalism as exemplified in his collection of photographs and costumes, in the midst of a growing Orientalist visual culture in turn-of-the-century Europe. Oppenheim is presented as a disseminator of new tastes and desires, anticipating the Orientalist costume parties, fashion shows, and theater productions in 1910s Europe. The development of photography as a medium, increased interest in ethnography among scientists, and rapid advances in fashion photography in particular helped to spread the reach of the Orientalism that Oppenheim pioneered. Tracing the Orientalist visual culture of his time, this paper uncovers how Oppenheim engaged with and perpetuated existing Orientalist fantasies but also diverged from common disseminations thereof.

With the analysis of two case studies, where a non-fictional third-person narrator represents the experience of nonfictional protagonists, the authors maintain Fictionality Studies should take into account not just prototypical cases of fictionality but also those that are more hybrid in nature, cases where signposts of fictionality are used locally in narratives that are globally marked as nonfiction. The examples-an interview and an online museum exhibition show that the employment of fictional modes of mind representation and cognitive attribution occur in conversational and documentary storytelling even if the reference is to the actual world.

"English","Friedrich Holderlin; Jean-Jacques Rousseau; conscience; voice; temporality",,"This article discusses the significance of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's notion of the conscience Friedrich Holderlin. In the eighteenth century, the soul was seen as an important source of energy and guidance in the intellectual life of individuals; Rousseau sees these energies as expressions (the voice of conscience) that lead to our moral betterment. Conscience is not only an ethical guide, rather it is also the basis of (self-)consciousness. For Holderlin, the constituent elements of conscience have two divergent sets of possibilities: in excess, thanatos and eros bring about our ruin but alternatively, they can converge constructively to form conscience that enables us to become autonomous historical agents. Rousseau is a crucial figure for Holderlin, especially in the poem ""Der Rhein,"" because in his writings, he finds a way of overcoming the destructive pull of eros and thanatos. Additionally, the reference to Rousseau's affirmation of conscience creates the basis of poetic self-reflexivity in ""Der Rhein"": it is the moment that uncovers the temporal and phenomenological affinities between human consciousness and signs of the God in the mundane world. It is in this way that Holderlin links poetic practice with historical agency.",29,"WOS:000408992300004",3

The larger aim is to expand our understanding of African movie genres by accounting for their technological and material dimensions. In Ghana, the earliest ghost movies, here represented by Ghost Tears (Socrate Safo, 1992) and Suzzy (Veronica Cudjoe, 1993), relied on analog visual effects to render the ghost as a visual trace of violence. Appearing almost a decade later, The Chase (Jon Gil, 2011) is noteworthy because it stretches the boundaries of the genre considerably. Jon Gil, the director and producer of the film, exploits digital tools to transform the ghost into a horrifying, multisensory experience; the ghost is felt as a disembodied, affective shock. In both cases, the ghost reflects back on its technological context in unanticipated ways.",38,"WOS:000405186400004",3

It uses the last minutes of ""The Wheel,"" the final episode of the first season of AMC's Mad Men (2007-15), as its primary example. More specifically, this article proposes three different interpretations of the final moments of that episode. These readings have in common that they underline one of Mitten's central claims, namely that serial television shifts comprehension processes toward conscious hypotheses in what he describes as ""operational aesthetic:' However, the article will also assume a broader perspective throughout and demonstrate that the three interpretations it develops are instances of more widely spread phenomena that merit far more attention than a single article can provide. Thus, the article offers, on the one hand, a close reading of an episode of Mad Men against the background of the early seasons of the show, but, on the other, it also identifies three topics for further fruitful research on television narrative more generally.",29,"WOS:000411300500008",3

Finally, at the intersection of spectator agency and theme, genre appears to be an ideological impulse, a way of relating to and encoding experience that begins with people and that they distribute over texts.

The article situates the film within responses to the real serial killer Fritz Haarmann to show how homosexuality was associated with violent crime and the seduction of children and youths during the Weimar Republic.

"English",,"'BEOWULF'","This article draws on evidence from archaeological investigation and land charters to argue for the influence of Anglo-Saxon execution practice on the representation of AE schere's head in Beowulf. The poet's depiction of the discovery of the severed head of Hroogar's retainer in a space defined as a borderland, where it has been left by his killer, Grendel's mother, can be seen to reflect the Anglo-Saxons' own judicial decapitation and display practices, which saw the heads of transgressors displayed on estate boundaries. Critics have identified similar echoes of decapitation on a border elsewhere in the corpus. The article argues that the severed head of AE schere is staged in this way to disturb the reader both through the violence done to the human body and through the sense of the unheimlich created by the hostile 'other' figure of Grendel's mother recognisably echoing the corporal punishment practices of Anglo-Saxon society.

"English","framing; emotion; genre; politics; French Revolution debate",,"This article draws together overlapping cognitive analyses of political thought, emotion, and language and shows how they can be supplemented with literary analyses of genre to illuminate the workings of the French Revolution debate of 1790s Britain. It focuses on enriching George Lakoff's theory of the multiple levels of framing in discourse, concentrating on the interplay of argument and narrative frames. Studies of emotion and mood in narrative genres are adapted to refine Lakoff's account of narrative, making it more complex, systematic, and sensitive to historical context. Applying the revised theory, the essay characterizes contrasts between Edmund Burke's and Thomas Paine's thought at all levels of framing. It shows how their lexical frames for ""revolution"" diverge as their main arguments craft opposing issue-defming frames for the central moral issue of revolution versus reform. Those arguments highlight different key figures and events yet draw on similar narrative genres to frame them. Importantly, high genres of heroic romance inspire elevation toward one's own side by celebrating victories and lamenting tragedies, and low genres of satire inspire contempt toward opponents by ridiculing deserved failures and absurd successes. Thus narrative genre ties surface-frame phrases like ""rights of man"" and ""swinish multitude"" to deep-frame assumptions about more fundamental concepts (human nature, society, government).",51,"WOS:000403740400008",3

Despite an increased interest in this mode of narration, a definition of specifically first-person plural narrative as an independent narrative form has not yet been suggested and we-narrators have been mostly measured by the I-narrator's yardstick. I propose instead to consider we-narrators as an independent type of a collective character narrator that distinguishes we-narratives as such from we-discourses in otherwise first-person narratives. To demonstrate that we-narrative exists as an independent narrative form, I will combine an analysis of three case studies short stories by William Faulkner and Joyce Carol Oates as well as a novel by Joshua Ferris with a discussion of existing contributions to the topic.

Tracing the neglected importance of Baconianism to the establishment of the First Folio's cultural prominence in the early twentieth century, parallels between the kinds of narratives told by authorship sceptics and by bibliographers are drawn.

"English",,,"This article evaluates the servant rape in Daniel Defoe's Roxana (1724) against conduct literature on the servant problem, and particularly against Defoe's multiple tracts on servants and supposedly promiscuous female domestic labourers. Like contemporary conduct writing, Roxana's rape narrative expresses intersecting social anxieties among employer classes over commerce infiltrating the domestic sphere and uncertainty related to contracted servants' virtue and obedience. Roxana specifically reflects conduct writers' association of female servants' disloyalty with sexual promiscuity. Yet, unlike Defoe's conduct literature, which avoids discussing servant rape, Roxana reflects the normalization of rape of female domestics. I argue that the novel's representation of rape deflects blame from male authority within the private sphere onto a female accomplice engaged in sexual labour beyond the bounds of the middle-class household. The narrative thus draws on the common occurrence of the rape of female servants but, at the same time, removes culpability from a readership whom Defoe protects as an ideologically moral employer class.",34,"WOS:000404040100002",3

I argue that Twain's The Gilded Age, which famously named the era, did more to shape future political conflicts than to describe those of its own time.

Teaching students who were historically excluded from higher education catalyzed a major shift in Rich's work: a move away from teaching traditional literary history toward the poetics of everyday life, and a related move away from hierarchical models of teaching and learning to a more collective, activist pedagogy, inspired by movements lor women's liberation, anti-imperialism, and black liberation and self-determination.

"English",,,"This article examines Barack Obama's eulogy on the occasion of Nelson Mandela's memorial on 10 December, 2013. Using a critical discourse analysis framework, the article demonstrates that Obama's eulogy is an act of memorialising Mandela that captures the life story of this statesman and also generates conversations about identity, participation and agency in both local and the global spaces. The eulogy privileges three qualities: making emotional connections with the audience through the use of adjectives, enhancing the ethos of Mandela by strengthening the pathos of the occasion and finally, interpolating Obama's own identity-formation by calling for action that perpetuates Mandela's magnanimous contributions. Although the word Ubuntu is only used twice in the eulogy, this article contends that it is this experience of being bound together in ways invisible to the eye that Obama focuses upon in order to make connections between apartheid and Jim Crow, the South African nationalist struggle and the Black American civil rights movement. In 1 945 words, Obama captures the complex selves of Mandela as politician, prisoner, husband, father, divorcee and sage statesman.",10,"WOS:000423794200003",3

"English",,,"This article examines common features in Swift, Pope and Sterne's responses to Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy and the wider humoral tradition. It documents the willingness of Swift and Pope simultaneously to take the latter discourse seriously-even to value humoral delusion-and yet to satirize its explanatory pretensions and the behavioural states it postulates; their tendency, also, to take a Janus-faced view of associated kinds of madness, affirming and deriding these concurrently. Sterne then recapitulates that stance in assuming a double perspective on hobby-horsical tendencies, and he combines this with a feel for the pathos and yet also delight which accompany the inevitable failure of Tristram Shandy's encyclopaedic pretensions. Swift and Sterne especially derive these dual perspectives from qualities incipient in the Anatomy, qualities which Burton had kept in check. In that respect, they (with Pope) transform humoral thinking into a sceptical resource, finding in it material supportive of an ironizing mind-set that willingly entertains multiple contradictory ideas at once. Such sceptical perspectivism is, I argue, characteristic of all three eighteenth-century authors discussed here and highlights their anticipation of Romantic irony.",72,"WOS:000422838700005",3

This attitude is evident in the fact that the texts dramatize personal acts of transcendence in the face of social repression. The speakers of the poems evidence a faith in the power of theatricality to allow the apprehension and revelation of an authentic self.

I argue that this short story translates scientific hypotheses from the nineteenth centuryCharles Darwin's botanical and zoological writings, for exampleinto the genre of the grotesque. Given the historical and geographic contexts in which Meyrink was writing, it is safe to say that his literature responds to an environmentally charged fear ubiquitous among industrialized or technologically advanced societies. Die Pflanzen des Dr. Cinderella demonstrates that Meyrink was concerned with the potential sentient nature of all living things and also with the agency of objects that many would consider dead matter.

Read in this light, Haggard's novel challenges the limits of an imperial power predicated on clear demarcations between civilized and savage practices.

"English","Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar; James Joyce; terkip; cultural authenticity; originality","TURKISH","This article examines how Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar's short story ""Yaz Gecesi (A Summer's Night)"" engages in a dialogue based on ""resemblance"" to James Joyce's short story, ""The Sisters."" In doing so, Tanpinar interrogates the discourses on authenticity and originality that emerged from the cultural politics of the early Turkish Republic. Read alongside Tanpinar's other literary critical concepts like terkip, his story forges important links to Joyce's concerns about narrative's ability to contain cultural continuity while grounding them in and for the Turkish context. Examining Tanpinar's critical writing on the Turkish novel, particularly the relationship between literary traditions and the concept of originality in the early Republic, this article demonstrates that Tanpinar's short story is a creative embodiment of his concept of terkip. Through analyzing Tanpinar's affirmation of the way literature from the past and from the West is integral for readers to interpret and derive meaning from contemporary Turkish literature, ""Yaz Gecesi"" can be read as a creative theorization of intercultural dialogue and intertextuality in the Turkish literary tradition.",28,"WOS:000419063500006",3
"English",,,"This article examines how Francisco Zamora Loboch, an Equatorial Guinean writer based in Madrid, interprets Miguel de Cervantes' novel Don Quijote as an anti-racist text. While first proposing this reading in his essay Como ser negro y no morir en Aravaca (1994), he develops it more fully in his poem, 'Estefania', from the collection Memoria de laberintos (1999). The study analyses how Zamora's poem interweaves elements from the original novel with allusions to the popular western novel, as well as to the history and culture of Annobon, in order to challenge what Anibal Quijano calls 'coloniality' (2000). In doing so, the poem deliberately merges the reality of life on Annobon, which has largely been characterized by poverty, exploitation, isolation, and neglect, with the patent fictionality of the Quijote and the western literary genre. This fusion of fiction and reality, which is modelled on the original Quijote, suggests that 'coloniality' is a fiction that can be radically reimagined and rewritten. Hence, the poem uses fiction as a key through which to dismantle and reimagine the interrelated edifices of the colonial, such as nationalism and the racialized binary between 'Africa' and 'Europe'.",30,"WOS:000404651900004",3

"English","allegory; American hegemony; Fury; hyperrealism; Salman Rushdie; signal crisis; terminal decline; world-system",,"This article examines how Salman Rushdie's Fury (2001) registers a signal crisis of American hegemony through its hyperreal production of an aesthetics of excess, constituted by fragmented subjectivities, a frenetic narrative form, references to the decaying years of the Roman Empire, and irruptions of violence against women. The text's libidinal investment of personal anguish with public discontent, or a psychopathological fury, is read through Fredric Jameson's account of third-world allegory as a symptom of the novel's registration of America's hegemonic decline. The scalping of several upper-class young women in New York City by their financier boyfriends is thus further examined as an aspect of the text's aesthetics of excess and use of allegory, which frames the violent interrelation between public discontent and private hubris. The murdered women are read as symbols of American hegemony and class under threat by turbulent financial markets, and hoarding their scalps is represented as a crude and violent attempt by their boyfriends to halt the dwindling value of America's cultural capital and financial markets. The destabilization of class structures due to turbulent financial markets breeds a semantic confusion between real and symbolic signifiers of class status, a process facilitated by the narrator's comparison of these women to prototypically American symbols, such as ""Oscar-Barbie"" statuettes and dolls. Fury's mapping of Solanka's cultural products, dolls and masks, from New York to the peripheral nation of Lilliput-Blefescu further actualizes the flow of American cultural and economic power to peripheral regions. This, alongside the text's problematic characterization of gender and race, is read as evidence of Rushdie as a writer in terminal decline.",46,"WOS:000412099400006",3

First, I discuss Grigson's poems of praise and tribute and his translations from Holderlin and Rilke, which he interspersed throughout Under the Cliff. Second, I explore his depiction of the 'pleasing decay' of ruins, which was shaped by his friendship with the artist John Piper and by his art-critical writings about Henry Moore and John Nash. Finally, I consider Grigson's adoption of the mode of visionary description he identified in the later poetry of John Clare. By openly signalling his debts, Grigson presents the activity of writing poetry as involving experiences of viewing, reading, appreciating, and interpreting other works of art.

This article, thus, brings a new approach to the critical debates and scholarship on these poets. The aim of the article is to show the individualistic and existentialist nature of the poetry of Frost and Ojaide. In the analysis, individualism is examined at the level of form and content; starting with the use of the lyric form and poet-persona inclusion in the poems to the thematisation of gloom and the importance of memory, among others.

I draw upon autobiography theory and previous studies of Boyle and Flanner to argue that both accounts pursue purposes other than the introspection and confession long associated with the memoir genre.

Although there have been broad surveys of bubonic plague in Middle English literature, as well as studies of isolated texts, this article is the first to examine the role of pestilence in a group of texts linked by theme and authorial intention. It contributes to current understanding of the disease in late medieval literature and culture, showing how authors utilised the idea of pestilence as a frightening cause of sudden death and as a form of rhetoric serving to encourage readers to reflect on mortality, the spiritual health of the soul and the prospect of salvation. Whereas previous research has shown that doctors, priests and writers interpreted the pestilence as a divine punishment for sin, this study demonstrates how that belief could be exploited for rhetorical purposes. The rhetoric of pestilence emerges as a powerful contemplative tool urging readers to practise self-examination, penitence and a more active, strategic approach to death.",29,"WOS:000422841500006",3

Ultimately, I elaborate a scholarly and pedagogically valid interpretation of Paz's text that tasks undergraduates to celebrate cultural diversity even while accounting for the text's historical context.

These interactions, the article argues, suggest not only a ferocious feminism, but also a kind of homoeroticism or lesbianism extant in the protagonist. In order to make these arguments, the study first analyzes the title of the book, Spleen, mapping out the term's use in medicine and how it is associated with the gendered neurological problem of hysteria approaching the early twentieth century. This association, placed up against melancholy (ennui) from Baudelaire, is then utilized to explore Ruth's ardent intellectual and feminist consciousness by which she refuses modern conventional reproductions of womanhood and maternity. Her refusal leads to the biblical story of Ruth, through which the article then assesses her defiance of heteronormativity via her rejection of heterosexuality and her penchant towards women. Together, these foci create an image of Ruth that suggests not just an extreme feminist character battling a modern melancholy, but further magnify her rejection of the maternal, and her subtler lesbian leanings.",26,"WOS:000395112800004",3

Although intended to be a loose adaptation of Madame Bovary, a relational reading of the screenplay and the film shows palimpsestuous emergence of themes, subthemes, and characters not only from the source text but also from Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd and the uprisings of 1848 in France and 1916 in Ireland. In addition, it is argued that the ghostly presence of Flaubert and Madame Bovary haunted the film and its authors and was a significant factor in the fashioning of a diegetic, transcultural adaptation that, having been largely overlooked and disparaged for over four decades, deserves to be critically reappraised and recognized as a powerful and dynamic adaptation and reinvention of Flaubert's classic novel.",44,"WOS:000397958600004",3

Sociologist George Ritzer's theory on the part played by shopping malls in the setting up and reinforcement of consumer capitalism is used to analyse how Tales front the Mall, which includes short stories, interviews, factoids, maps and photographs, documents the way ""cathedrals of consumption"" induce a dialectics of enchantment/disenchantment, and ultimately strip humans of their humanity, by giving themselves over to what Ritzer describes as the nullities.""

I argue that Joseph Anton, published in 2012, exhibits evidence of Rushdie's attempt at authorial self-fashioning, and therefore the memoir represents an important part of his effort to shape the public narrative about him. Joseph Anton highlights Rushdie's exilic persona through direct comparisons to figures like Voltaire and Galileo, and attempts to privilege this position above his other authorial selves. This authorial self has deep roots in a narrative fashioned by Rushdie that has been abetted by some of his critics and the media since the fatwa. My essay critiques this emphasis, suggesting that Rushdie's self-fashioning is out of step with his twenty-first-century political ideals and affiliations.

The mapping exercises involved in the early, heroic-era Antarctic expeditions, helped to reduce a once mysterious and unknown landscape into a known entity, something that could be contained and restrained through visual representation. These maps focus on the limits of landscape, on the outer edges and the upper peaks and so mapping minimises and places limits upon landscapes, creating an image of the landscape which is static, re-presented for human consumption. The article will, therefore, look at the use of maps in a cross-section of six heroic-era Antarctic non-fiction narratives for children written within the last twenty years, and which recount the early Antarctic expeditions, recreating and re-presenting heroic-era maps as a means of enforcing stasis on this dynamic landscape.

The X-Men comics in the late 1970s and 1980s used the legacy of the Holocaust as a means to transform the Magneto character from villain to hero. This inclusion of the Holocaust was partly a response to contemporary developments in American observances of the Holocaust (creative and institutional). Even though this conflation of history and fiction was meant to facilitate a new identity, it yielded a vexed identity politics that endured in the comics for decades. Magneto had originally been a villain, defined by his notions of genetic supremacy and his willingness to employ mass violence against those he deemed genetically inferior. These early - associations remained in the character even as they were insistently overwritten by his (new) past as a Holocaust survivor. At the same time, the comics refrained from identifying Magneto as a Jew-that identity was suggested but never stated.

"English","analogy; naturalism; notebooks; poetics; symbolism",,"This article examines the concept of attention in Gabriele D'Annunzio's oeuvre, arguing for its central position in the development of his aesthetic thought and of his creative activity. In one of his Faville del maglio (Sparks from the Hammer) entitled Dell'attenzione' (Of attention', 1911), D'Annunzio referred to attention as his ability to exceptionally stretch his senses in order to perceive every detail of things, people and events surrounding him. This permanent effort enabled him not only to gather a thorough comprehension of reality, but also to reach its ultrasensitive sides and to perceive what is usually hidden to sensory perception. D'Annunzio's attention can thus be considered as a sort of sixth sense', an instrument for both investigating the world and translating it into literature through poetic activity. The first part of the article discusses the concept of attention in the Spark, focusing especially on its links with D'Annunzio's symbolist poetics and on its chiefly practical nature. In the second section I argue that this faculty was exercised by D'Annunzio through a specific physical tool, i.e. his notebooks, which can be considered as the concrete embodiment of this extraordinary sense.",45,"WOS:000405077300005",3
"English","alchemy; cross-breeding; eighteenth-century botany; eighteenth-century chemistry; hybridity; mechanical philosophy; species stability","ALCHEMY","This article examines the concept of equilibrium in the hybridity experiments of the eighteenth-century botanist Joseph Gottlieb Koelreuter. The notion of equilibrium enables Koelreuter to insist on the stability of species, while at the same time acknowledging the creation of new forms. In employing the idea of equilibrium, Koelreuter makes use of a curious mixture of vitalist and mechanical language that he drew from existing al/chemical accounts. By doing so, Koelreuter fits in none of the existing narratives of the history of science. In an older account, modern chemistry emerged when it abandoned alchemy and embraced the scientific and rational principles of mechanical philosophy. In a more recent narrative, modern chemistry first found a new, representational language and then, in an independent second step, embraced mechanical principles (cf. Golinski). Koelreuter neither abandoned alchemical thought, nor did he reject metaphorical language. In a time of disciplinary stratification, he freely drew on a number of models from different discourses and times. Embracing the conceptual wealth of al/chemistry, Koelreuter was able to account for phenomena that could not be explained in existing models of reproduction and cross-breeding.",39,"WOS:000399662200002",3
"English",,,"This article examines the contribution of the young adult series Pretty Little Liars to contemporary understandings of the teenage girl. Over the course of eighteen novels, protagonists Hanna, Emily, Spencer, and Aria struggle to escape the mysterious ""A,"" who sees their every move, manipulates them into embarrassing situations, and publicly airs their secrets. I argue that the series productively utilizes the paranoid form to interrogate particular forms of cultural condescension towards adolescent girls. The narrative of As prosecutions illustrates how young women are perceived as rightful subjects of surveillance and how they continue to be shamed for sexual expression and bodily non-conformity. Pretty Little Liars also plays with gendered language, complicating the pop-culture trope of the ""mean girl,"" often used to pathologize girls' anger, by detaching the character A from gender altogether. The series further circulates the problematic word ""bitch,"" and in so doing replicates the slippery postfeminist terrain in which words reclaimed as empowering can also be used against girls to cut and wound. Analysis of the teenage girl's tenuous place in Pretty Little Liars is contextualized both within the postfeminist moment and within the contemporary young adult market, which financially relies on adolescent female readers but too often disdains their tastes.",121,"WOS:000413991100004",3

For Calvin, creation is an expression of the creator, one that is precisely ordered and uniquely accommodated to human cognition; as such, it is a finely crafted rhetorical statement, full of tropes and figures intended to be read and glossed. Terry builds upon this conception of the world to construct a portrait of India that construes it as part of a divinely authored argument a contrariis writ large across the breadth of creation, a figure juxtaposed against England in order to amplify-according to good rhetorical practice-its respective virtues and vices.",41,"WOS:000426730200004",3

Its case study is the Oxford Library of African Literature, edited in the mid-20th century by anthropologists E.E. Evans-Pritchard, Godfrey Lienhardt and W.H. Whiteley, who organized the transcription, translation, and publication of oral narratives from across Africa as hardback books. The first two volumes were commissioned with sponsorship from UNESCO, but few volumes included contributions from academics from Africa - notwithstanding Chinua Achebe's foreword for the first. By engaging with a rarely scrutinized literary collection, this article suggests that literarity is ultimately a colonialist construct and that orature, within this period, is only valued as gaining cultural capital as literature following its transcription and translation into English by British agents consecrating it into the model of the English book.",53,"WOS:000417631400008",3

The children with an illustrated copy engaged with the text more deeply and critically than the others. They were also more likely to relate the story to their own lives. The illustrations were found to work alongside the participants' own visualisations rather than replacing them, and opened up further possible interpretations rather than limiting them.

The article focuses on specific paradigmatic snapshots that ascribe a certain value to disequilibrium: William Hogarth's Analysis of Beauty, Schiller's Anmuth und Wurde, Schelling's early philosophy of nature, and the Homunculus episode of Faust II. These texts frame affirmative disequilibrium in different modes: as a perceptual technology (aesthetic disequilibrium), as a way of being in the world (ethical disequilibrium), or as a basic structure of givenness (ontological disequilibrium). Each instance of affirmative disequilibrium makes possible a form of thought in which disruption, disjunction, or deviance constitutes the condition of possibility of the author's respective investments, whether in an aesthetics of stimulation (Hogarth), an ethics of sovereignty (Schiller), or an ontology of agonistic forces that frames systemic inconsistency as a source of affirmative potentiality (Schelling).

"English",,,"This article examines the extensive and previously underexplored eighteenth-century records of the University Library at St Andrews, demonstrating their considerable potential for enhancing and complicating our existing accounts of book use and reading within eighteenth-century institutions. It uses accessions lists, borrowing registers and surviving books to investigate the far-reaching effects of the 1710 Copyright Act and to trace St Andrews' readers' enthusiastic and vociferous engagements with poetry, novels, criticism and plays. Legal deposit under the 1710 Act has often been seen as being relatively ineffectual, but St Andrews' records provide compelling evidence that it had a transformative material and intellectual impact on the university, in part through its providing considerable quantities of modern literature. While vernacular literary works were neglected in the English universities, in Scotland in general and in St Andrews in particular they came to play pioneering roles in arts curricula and circulated freely from libraries for formal study and leisurely perusal. St Andrews' accessions lists record the significant direct and indirect impacts of legal deposit legislation on the composition of the library. A series of slice samples from the borrowing registers shows a narrow canon of exemplary literary writers giving way to more various and heterogeneous patterns of reading in which the novel became increasingly dominant. Finally, a rich vein of surviving eighteenth-century marginalia demonstrates that St Andrews' students employed literary works as media for contentious, emotional and experimental discourses with each other, with their institution and with the social and affective values of the culture at large.",48,"WOS:000422838700006",3

There has been much debate as to whether Gowther's canine performance should be understood as symbolic or literal, performed or essential, rehabilitative or punitive. Drawing on previously unexplored analogues from the Perceval/Parzival cycle in which sinful knights undergo comparable canine performances, this article argues that Gowther's penance represents a rehabilitative and curative ""technology of the self."" Moreover, it demonstrates that the ultimate inspiration for Gowther's penance derives from the legends of the Cynics, who advocated living life in the manner of dogs and according to the barest possible forms of animal existence. In the final analysis, the tale of Sir Gowther embraces a view of animality that rejects the normative hierarchy God-human-animal, and posits a surprising inversion: God-Christian-animal-sinner.",72,"WOS:000415638600003",3

I argue that the mestizo petitionary record was made as an archival' countermove to the exclusionary legislation that in the 1570s targeted individuals of Spanish-Native parentage, and that chiefly aimed to bar them from the provincial priesthood. In that petitionary record, the probanzaa notarial form of sworn witness testimonyplayed a key role in the realignment and readjustment of the archival record pertaining to mestizos; one that had a changing impact in the ensuing crown legislation of the late 1580s, and that served as foundational' legal precedent in future Hispano-Andeans' appeals at the Council of the Indies, in Madrid.",57,"WOS:000414802600006",3

I will discuss how transsexual people first used memoir to counter sensationalistic mass media coverage, and then how feminist critiques of their works led to post-transsexual' theory, which deconstructed the conventions and cliches that the transition memoir genre had developed. These theorists suggested new ways to document gender-variant lives beyond a generalised desire for public acceptance and in response to social concerns: the policies of the gender identity clinics, who decided who could access medical services, and on what terms, especially the demand that patients pass' in their acquired genders and hide their histories; and the exclusion of trans people from feminist spaces, and gay/lesbian politics.

The context for the modern in theatre is provided by visual art as represented by the Progressive Artists' Group, poetry as represented by B.S. Mardhekar, Dilip Chitre and Arun Kolatkar, and short fiction as represented by writers like Vyankatesh Madgulkar and Arvind Gokhale.

It begins with the writer Gide and the critic and philosopher Sartre, some of whose works on black Africa belong to the first decade after the Second World War, which was marked by France's continued imperial presence in the continent. It then considers the agronomist Dumont, the sociologist Negroni, the economist and human rights activist Verschave, and the novelists Le Clezio and Constant, whose books appeared in the following decades, which saw the official dissolution of empire and the emergence of a politically independent Africa. The aim is to analyse closely how these scholars and writers call into question the economic realities of France's expansionist policy in black Africa. My claim is that, read as a unit, their texts constitute an act of European self-confession.

Beginning with a comparative reading of Barnes's novel and Kermode's critical classic of the same name, it shows how Barnes's narrator's need for Kermodian concord fictions causes him to distort and misremember his own past, making it shallower and more banal than it truly was. Engaging earlier critical literature on the novel, the article also reads Wilde's De Profundis (and Bosie's responses to it) as nonfiction counterparts to the project of Barnes's narrator. Wilde's own narrative self-realization is cited as a positive counterexample, while Douglas's Autobiography offers a sharp negative contrast.

I reopen the problem of consciousness for interpretation by examining challenges to scientific authority in the 1930s, specifically how Kenneth Burke and Alfred North Whitehead respond to a ""crisis in mathematics"" born out of Whitehead's attempt, with Bertrand Russell, to reconcile logic and mathematics. Whitehead uses Russell's paradox to demonstrate the necessary return of subjective inquiry as a legitimate mode of knowledge. Burke's Permanence and Change develops Whitehead's arguments to justify interpretative approaches to knowledge. Examining their arguments reveals an analogous ""crisis in the humanities"" in which language or culture is substituted for the examination of subjectivity.

"English",,,"This article examines the philosophical stakes of Eliza Haywood's confrontation with a topical economic crisis: the South Sea Bubble of 1720. In Memoirs of a Certain Island (1725), Haywood recalibrates her theory of erotic desire to the conditions of the market. Her project intersects in two ways with John Locke's arguments in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (169094). First, Haywood follows Locke in using the category of desire to relate personal experience to social formation. In her hands, desire accounts for speculative investment as well as erotic coupling. Second, Haywood shows that the desire licensed by modern finance threatens the ""self-consciousness"" that, for Locke, defines personal identity. Desire works differently in Memoirs of a Certain Island than it does in Haywood's more familiar writings, such as Fantomina (1725). Rather than promoting self-consistency, speculative desire disorders the minds of people that it actuates. Haywood articulates the solution, as well as the problem, through the idiom of sexual passion.

It is argued that the particular use and function of a map depends on its shape or placement in a book, distinguishing between the incorporation of maps only as a significant picture (its use) from the subject within the whole narrative (its function). Thus the article articulates what uses a map can have within a narrative. It also explores the mechanics of the iconotext, showing that a cartographic picture fulfils a precise, rather than a general, function of spatialisation. Hence three main functions of spatialisation in maps and mapping are distinguished, whereby an author could use maps to help a character discover, conquer, or organise a space.",36,"WOS:000394961600003",3

While Howe has long been thought an important, if peripheral, member of the Language writing group, I argue that her poetry is fundamentally opposed to the central beliefs of the Language writers, as it is uninterested in the participation of the reader in the meaning of the poem or the participation of the poem in contemporary politics. Lyn Hejinian's work, in contrast, is designed to develop a quotidian creative practice that merges aesthetics and politics. It is no surprise, then, that Hejinian has been actively involved in and published articles detailing Occupy's political formation. Both her poetry and Occupy's politics depend on a presentist temporality, which prevents Occupy from producing the conditions by which its utopian premise might be fulfilled. The very aesthetic commitments that make Howe appear in opposition to the participatory aesthetics and politics of Occupy entail a far more progressive and utopian vision of the future and fill in the gap in their political theory.",17,"WOS:000416544100001",3

Spark's Marcia Blaine School and Ishiguro's Hailsham masquerade as microcosms of a homogeneous British nation only through a rigorous process of racial redaction.

"English",,,"This article examines the reception of troubadour song in So fo e.l temps, a thirteenth-century Occitan narrative by Catalan author Raimon Vidal. While in this work the Limousin troubadours are revered as authorities, their lyrics and the mistaken reception of them are also subject to scrutiny. In this, So fo e.l temps resembles Raimon's earlier Rapos de trabar, a grammar of the troubadour vernacular. In the Rapos de trabar, Raimon complains that while the nouns (or substance) of troubadour lyric are good, its verbs (or predication) are faulty. Troubadour lyric therefore needs to be handled with expertise - which his grammar aims to teach to a select few. In So fo e.l temps, Catalan nobleman Uc de Mataplana models this connoisseurship, displaying his dialectical and rhetorical skills as he critiques the use made of troubadour lyric by a lovelorn trio in Limousin. He finds fault with the timeless substance of troubadour love doctrine, which does not translate to the context of lived experience, as the dilemma of the Limousin lovers attests. Uc's surprising resolution of their situation reveals, however, the complexity of a cultural project that seeks to build - and profit from - the prestige of another vernacular culture, and to demonstrate the superiority of a newer, Catalan, one.",25,"WOS:000413760100001",3
"English",,,"This article examines the relationship between Mallarme and postcolonial Antillean poetics, especially as articulated by the Martinican writer Edouard Glissant. Rather than tracing the notable flashes of Mallarme in Glissant's work, it reads Mallarme forward, into the postcolonial present. Glissant's notion of ""creolization"" suggests how a critique of ancestral roots must take the form of a poetics of chance (hasard). What might this imply for Mallarme's two chief texts about chance? Igitur and Un coup de des lend themselves to a creolized reading, one that focuses on these works' preoccupation with ancestry and their attempts to overcome this preoccupation by embracing chance encounters, vagabondage, or errancy. Igitur begins with this ambition but ultimately fails, resulting in an enclosed ""encryption""; Un coup de des tarries with this enclosure at first but then ends with an ""enciphering,"" using its opacity to open the poem to future reconstructions and to reveal the composite, chance-driven structures underlying its poetics. This critical procedure suggests hope for redemption from the metaphysical and epistemological ""abysses"" that are so central to Mallarme's and Glissant's poetics.",30,"WOS:000400951200010",3
"English",,,"This article examines the relationship between the Querelle des anciens et des modernes and the Querelle des femmes as it was articulated in `Le Parnasse reconnoissant, ou, Le triomphe de Madame Des-Houlieres' by Marie-Jeanne L'Heritier. Published in 1694 as a riposte to Boileau's misogynist Satire X, the text contributes to the tradition of defences of women. However, L'Heritier deliberately inserts her rejoinder into the Querelle des anciens et des modernes; in so doing, she responds to another work by Boileau, the Dialogue des heros de roman. After establishing how different quarrels and concerns combine in Boileau's two texts, this article argues that L'Heritier consciously exploited the platform of `Ancients and Moderns' to discuss women's cultural practice. While this confirms the critical view that the two quarrels were interlinked, it also reveals a hierarchy of quarrels in which the Querelle des anciens et des modernes had greater capital; as such it proved useful for a woman entering the literary field. L'Heritier's strategies demonstrate the complexities of being a Modern woman writer, despite the typical alignment of these identities, and invite us to examine how this contemporary hierarchization of quarrels has shaped their recent reception.",50,"WOS:000397104300002",3
"English","Masculinity; Bront; classic novel adaptation; emotion; Jane Eyre; Wuthering Heights",,"This article examines the representation of masculinity in twenty-first-century television adaptations of Charlotte and Emily Bront's respective novels, Jane Eyre (1847) and Wuthering Heights (1847): the BBC's 2006 four-part serialization of Jane Eyre (dir. Susanna White) and ITV's 2009 two-part serialization of Wuthering Heights (dir. Coky Giedroyc). It argues that twenty-first-century television is affording the Bronts' heroes, Rochester and Heathcliff, freer licence to express sensitive emotions, which are represented as a positive force of their masculinity rather than a site of frailty or impotence. By foregrounding male emotion, the adaptations are participating in wider ideological debates concerning men's position in a post-feminist world. Importantly, by emphasizing Rochester and Heathcliff's emotionality, the adaptations are seen to work against Brontean myths and screen legacies that have so often branded them as gothic hero-villains or rakes. This article argues that the representation of emotionally liberated masculinity, particularly in a period where notions of sexual equality and women's rights are embedded in the social fabric, provides the adaptations with the cultural freedom to present Rochester and Heathcliff through a more sympathetic lens. These characterizations are achieved by centralizing the heroes, softening the contours of their Victorian masculinities (and those depicted in earlier adaptations), and showing that their iniquities are largely the result of their psychological suffering and victimization. In these ways, the heroes' respective behaviours are reframed as sites of empathy, which abate, in some measure, the cloud of antipathy that has usually followed them to the screen.",47,"WOS:000397958600005",3

Although Pales's poems do not explicitly address environmental concerns, they actively respond to colonial forms of capitalist developmentalism that shaped the Caribbean during the first half of the twentieth century. Pales offers a critical portrayal of a ""natural"" landscape dominated by multinational economic interests and by unsustainable models of tourism. In contrast, in some of his poems Pales offers a more ecological vision of nature anchored in the realm of Afro-Caribbean spiritual belief systems. However, Pales does not present an idealized view of nature-his ironic perspective remains ambivalent between a critique of a capitalist modernity in which nature is simply an exploitable resource, and a sacred vision to which modernity, including the poet himself, no longer has access.",52,"WOS:000406330700003",3

The importance of the character's supporting role varies according to the era in which each play is written. At first, in the medieval religious dramas of the Crown of Aragon, the pilgrim not only celebrates St. Christopher's piety and anticipates his meeting with Jesus Christ, but also embodies the sanctity and devotion necessitated of pilgrimage. The pilgrims undergo a transformation in the sixteenth century as they become comic and serve as foils to the protagonist's gravity. On the seventeenth-century secular stage, the representations diverge: they begin with a traditional representation of the pilgrim, but then the figure ultimately disappears as the comedias focus on the later period of St. Christopher's life, the result of a Tridentine directive that refocused the general worship of saints and hagiographical literature.",26,"WOS:000398076100001",3

The past decades saw the rise of texts which not only challenge the convention of traditional autobiography and its reader-writer pact', but also integrate visual modes of representation in the fabric of the narrative, as tools and metaphors for the process of projection of the self that is autofiction. As television became an essential medium to promote and disseminate the figure of the intellectual in France, it has also been used as a tool to shape and manipulate the notion of authorship in life-writing. Drawing on examples including Duras's televised performance and more recent texts by Beigbeder, Angot, Nothomb and Delaume, this article examines the use of the televised medium as site of contention for authors who have aptly exploited the potential of the small screen within and outside their textual productions. The conclusion asks if autofiction can be perceived as a literary equivalent of reality television.",57,"WOS:000392419900002",3

"English",,,"This article examines the supernatural in Ruth Rendell's fiction. Rendell was fascinated by the supernatural and returned to it throughout her writing career. The essay begins by looking at the manifestation of ghosts as a symptom of domestic entrapment. These ghosts are an extension of women's curtailed and claustrophobic lives. It then explores the depiction of mediums and soothsayers, which, although allowing more agency for women, still leaves unresolved slippages between the real and the not real. The article ends by looking at Rendell's haunted men, arguing that there is a relatively conventional expansion of the imagination for men who become aware of the possibility of the supernatural. The article argues that the gender divide apparent in Rendell's depiction of ghost seeing and occult practices provides the critique of conventional gender roles and expectations that is so much a part of all her work. However, the role the supernatural plays in her fiction goes further and expresses an apparent doubt that Rendell feels about the actual materiality of ghosts and the efficacy of occult practices. Rendell's treatment of the supernatural is insistently ambivalent. This essay argues that for someone who states so clearly, ""I don't, of course, believe in ghosts"" (""Ruth Rendell reads""), Rendell surprisingly refuses to dismiss them.",25,"WOS:000398033400006",3

Cheng's engagement with, and departure from, canonical Western novelistic models such as Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu in Le Dit reveals his 'comparatist' ambition to reorient Western cultural heritage by putting it into dialogue with that of the East. L'A parts per thousand ternit,, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with a translingual rewriting of Chinese literary traditions such as that of classical romance. While the first model applies principles of analogy, the second reflects a more traditional conception of translation that emphasizes faithfulness and authenticity. The two models are mutually complementary rather than exclusive. The study pays special attention to Cheng's 'Chinese-inked' French language and style, highlighting the aesthetic innovations and challenges in Cheng's transcultural writings.",42,"WOS:000400998700004",3

With reference to Martin, Millard, Price and practitioners Waldo Salt, Raul Ruiz and Mike Leigh, I define this activity as a form of 'underwriting'. This term refers to the creation of fictional, written or audio-visual work that does not feature in the screenplay but helps to inform the creation of characters, narrative and story world. The writers/directors listed above are noted for creating a mass of material that contributes towards the richness of their work but is not intended for publication in script form or in the final film. I then report on my own digital 'underwriting' in the early development of a feature film tentatively titled Fireflies. This activity has involved the use of digital cameras, mobile phones and social media to document and develop a screen idea during workshops with actors. The result is the creation of a mass of creative material (character improvisations, profiles and filmed 'test scenes') that informs the writing of my screenplay. Finally, I consider how this 'underwriting' might also function as an audience development tool. I situate my work alongside current industry practices in Australia and abroad (such as the production of proof-of-concept videos and mood reels) to demonstrate the increasingly common and desirable use of digital tools in the early development of a screen idea for both writer and audience.",25,"WOS:000418325900005",3
"English","Biography; Fiction; Picturebooks; Peter Sis",,"This article examines the use of maps in the works of Czech authorillustrator Peter Sis in order to consider the role that cartography plays in the construction of four of his biographical picturebooks: Follow the Dream: The Story of Christopher Columbus (2003/1991), Starry Messenger: Galileo Galilei (1996), The Tree of Life: A Book Depicting the Life of Charles Darwin, Naturalist, Geologist and Thinker (2003), and The Pilot and the Little Prince: The Life of Antoine de Saint-Exupery (2013). The profusion of maps found in Sis's biographical picture-books expresses an understanding that the exploration of identity is intimately linked with the exploration of the spaces in which that identity is formed. The maps represent three basic functions for Sis: first, he uses maps to situate the reader in a specific time and place; second, maps are elements that initiate adventure; and third, the profusion of maps, combined with other textual elements, raises a question that runs through all of Sis's work regarding the limits of representations of reality.

The article suggests that the various debates that arose in the aftermath of 9/11-the status of fiction after tragedy, the theses on the demise of irony and satire, the high expectations put on canonical authors to give meaning to the event, and standardized explorations of the figure of the terrorist Other-all served to construct readings for The Zero that fell within prescriptive approaches to post-9/11 fiction and thus missed its highly subversive potential. While recent academic output is starting to explore The Zero in innovative ways, early reception failed to examine it conceptually and formally, favoring as it did a trauma studies approach that resulted in a bland analysis of the novel's focus on terrorist figures.

La Pointe Courte was significant to the French New Wave not only in its use of American literary modernist narrative strategies but in its execution of a new model of adaptive poetics that brazenly flouted expectations of fidelity to a literary source. La Pointe Courte's adaptation of The Wild Palms by William Faulkner-a central literary reference for French film critics after the Second World War-supplied an important, but often uncredited, blueprint for directors like Alain Resnais and Jean-Luc Godard, whose films modelled on literary modernist prose and abstracted, deliberately unfaithful filmic adaptations would be more readily recognized by critics for their originality. Varda's analogical literary adaptation anticipated shifts in cinematic style that would echo throughout later works by directors affiliated with the Nouvelle Vague, including Godard and Resnais.

It examines changes in how the author's profile has been mobilised, and more broadly what the differences between these adaptations reveal about the production cultures that created them and the changing international landscape in which such dramas have been developed. Firstly, A Perfect Spy is analysed as an in-house BBC production which utilises the characteristics of heritage drama to portray a crisis in the traditional spy hero of the John Buchan mould, providing an intimate view of a man destroyed by contradictory inheritances. Yet I argue that the adherence to heritage resulted in an overtly reverential adaptation, abandoning the novel's formally experimental features and blunting much of its impact. This is contrasted with The Night Manager, developed within an increasingly globalised independent production sector by members of le Carre's family with BBC at a greater remove. This serial, described by its production team as a 'radical' adaptation, breaks free of the overt heritage imagery of prior le Carre adaptations with a focus on the glamorous jet-setting super-rich, even as the theme of inheritance seems more relevant than ever at a production level. I explore the impact of this on decisions to rewrite the narrative and impose a more heroic ending, thereby rejecting the moral ambiguity with which le Carre had long been associated.",48,"WOS:000417299000001",3

Reading Erauso's Vida against the backdrop of the military revolution and concurrent social upheavals, and alongside other military memoirs from the period, I argue that there is an underlying coherence between the Vida's criminal episodes and heroic scenes, which in turn reflects a conflicted notion of martial honour that comprises both exemplary conduct and transgression. At stake in this recontextualization of the Vida is a more nuanced grasp of the text itself and a more capacious understanding of the ways in which the professionalization of war was represented in early modern literature.",40,"WOS:000394529800002",3

In writing about issues like ""race"", identity and belonging in these texts, Krog is asking, ""[t]o whom does the South African nation belong?"" - a question that was central to debates about the National Question by liberation movements during apartheid. Although the ""new"" South Africa arguably is very different from the new ""nation"" that had been imagined, the National Question remains of importance. A postcolonial reading of the transformation trilogy encourages a focus on the National Question and the factors that complicate it.

"English","poetry reception; cross-cultural reading; literary imagination; embodied mind; imagery",,"This article explores the common ground and poetic elements for cross-cultural reading of literary works. As a typical literary form, poetry amply contains the characteristics of literary works and stimulates the imagination of the readers. To investigate the reading experience with poetry, an empirical study on the cross-cultural poetry reading has been conducted and carried out in China and Germany, respectively. The study adopts a psychological approach to evaluate readers' mental reaction to and involvement in classical Chinese and German poems, and combines these with the assessment of quantitative monitoring of brain function. The results from the different measurements indicate that the aesthetic imagination can trigger more aesthetic enjoyment and significantly reduce anxiety. In line with literary theories and evolutionary psychology, these empirical findings, combined with poetic analyses, indicate that the key to immediate involvement in a cross-cultural poetry reading might lie in the description, which is closely connected to the embodied experience of the readers. The results from the interdisciplinary study provide further evidence that supports the assumption of the role of the embodied mind in cross-cultural literary reading, confirming and advancing classic literary theories. These findings open new perspectives for future studies on cross-cultural poetic reading and literary imagination.",33,"WOS:000422844400008",3

This article also argues that the authorial presence is inscribed in a screenplay through the decision-making processes within screenwriting practice which lead the screenwriter to make many concrete and conceptual choices based on their own knowledge, perceptions and sensibilities. By disengaging the argument for voice from questions of quality, any voice is opened to interrogation and description based on its stylistic continuities.

The texts under discussion are: Meg Vandermerwe's Zebra Crossing (2013), Lauren Beukes's Zoo City (2010) and Eben Venter's Wolf, Wolf (2013). All three novels, in unusual ways, engage with xenophobia and employ animals, animal metaphors and animalised humans in their narratives. All trouble the boundaries between self and other and centre bodies as the place from which relations with others are conducted. This article will focus on the descriptions of African migrants in these texts, and the manner in which they are animalised. It will also question the extent to which writing embodied others - be they animal or foreigner - remains a way of writing about the embodied self. Finally, this article will consider whether the use of animal metaphors disrupts humanist exhortations against xenophobia.",33,"WOS:000398901800006",3

However, when appropriated by future generations, it can readily metamorphose into authoritative discourse. On the other hand, patriarchal ideology in the text, which is a priori, is more authoritative and less amenable to dialogization.

The discussion is exemplified by specific consideration of the treasure map from Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island (1883) and the map of the turtle island in the German children's picturebook Kapt'n Sharky und das Geheimnis der Schatzinsel (2006), which are also seen as examples of treasure maps which play with the expectations of both readers and characters alike, all tied to the X found on any treasure map.

"English",,,"This article explores the interface between two fields of enquiry that have developed with rather differing sets of priorities: textual genetics and postcolonial studies. Textual genetics has placed the emphasis on writing as a process, deeply influenced by a whole range of factors both literary and non-literary. Its attendant desacralization of the notion of the `definitive' text as the prime object of study, or as a privileged site for the understanding of a writing project, further problematizes the nature of textuality. Postcolonial approaches to literary study, on the other hand, have frequently foregrounded the importance of the social, political, and cultural contexts from which texts emerge and to which they respond, thereby often deflecting attention from strictly literary concerns. The detailed consideration of the genesis of Ahmadou Kourouma's first novel, Les Soleils des inde 'pendances, presented here, involves a process of `un-making' that sees the original manuscript of the novel relegated to the status of an avant-texte of the shorter version, published by Seuil in 1970.

Beginning with the premise that both fiction and autobiography elicit a readerly absorption that effaces the act of enunciation such that the act of writing is foreclosed from the manifest text, I argue that in W ou le souvenir d'enfance, the enunciative plane becomes inscribed as a blank in the text. This elision, then, becomes an emblem for the very undepictability that, I argue, serves as the real subject of Perec's text - the memories that are missing from the writer's consciousness, and the resulting inability to identify himself with the child he once was. The text's refusal to remain secure in either the genre of fiction or autobiography emphasizes the undepictable at the expense of the represented content. Such a strategy, I argue, serves, on one level, as an approach toward depicting the trauma of the writer's childhood in occupied France, but on another level, as an exploration of the limits of the ability of narrative to represent reality.",37,"WOS:000409135200001",3

A close reading shall illustrate that the archiving of Lucy turns out to be an ambivalent endeavour since her aesthetic re-visioning is oscillating between the presence and absence: whereas Lucy's absence is the origin of the speaker's melancholic archival fever, her subsequent re-visioning results in a ghostly presence that can only be discerned by following her traces - traces that ultimately indicate the archive's (i.e. spaces, the archiving subject, and the poem itself) inherent destructive side and its spectrality.",44,"WOS:000405514900003",3

Yet as the economic crisis increased, Spanish governments, mass media, and corporations promoted this narrative of success as a compensation mechanism, aiming at making up for the country's dire financial situation. In the European media, the initially benign portrait of Spaniards was gradually transformed into a new representation that depicted Iberians as slackers and scroungers of European Union funds.

The article argues that recent work on fictionality (and on historical poetics generally) allows us to come to a richer understanding of the terms on which early Americans valued fiction, bringing into view a series of historical contestations over fictionality's cultural meaning and purpose. These contestations, in turn, reveal just how delimited a sense of fiction's value and possible uses underpins our current debates. After a brief reading of Royal!

The article addresses the idea of how such collaboration works, and how each of the voices represent themselves as the project develops. As will be revealed, these voices are often in competition and have vested interests in how the final script emerges, suggesting that the scriptwriter is often cast as the mediator of such interests and responsible for maintaining creative integrity, political balance, social focus and economic viability. In this case it was required that the scriptwriter constantly be asserted as a particular role with specific skillsets, which was often overlooked when the project's collaborators viewed the expression of an idea, an intervention about narrative or the provision of technical information as an act worthy of a script credit.

The story is set in the days of Japanese imperialism and revolves around the relationship between Minami sensei, a young Korean intellectual studying abroad at the University of Tokyo, and Haruo Yamada, a boy of mixed heritage who was born to a Japanese father and a Korean mother. Like reflections in a mirror, the two figures portray certain contradictions within the empire with their ""virtual"" identities, which refer to identities borrowed or imagined by the colonized self. While briefly introducing Sa-ryang Kim's literary achievements, this paper discusses the writings of Koreans during the era of Japanese imperialism. And by delving into the two characters, the paper examines how their identities are defined by Japanese imperialism. Then, as the analysis reveals that the two are complementary figures reflecting each other's hybrid identity, this study explores how the identity of imperialist diaspora during the colonial period was represented. The protagonist eventually accepts the Korean title Nam sensei together with the Japanese title Minami sensei, and confirms his membership in the colonial diaspora. In contrast, Haruo Yamada identifies his projected self as Japanese, deriding the Korean teacher. This inconsistency is a testament to the wide spectrum of types of identities internalized within the people in ""colonial diaspora,"" who are, in this case, Koreans who had dispersed outside their colonized homeland and settled in the empire of Japan.

Whiston advertised this tract as an attack on the Methodists and their perceived ally, William Law. However, this paper argues that anti-Methodism was merely a smokescreen which enabled Whiston to profess his loyalty to the established Church, while he advanced various heterodox views. Whiston's controversial opinions included his rejection of the Augustinian doctrine of original sin, along with his subtle show of support for the annihilationist views which his uncle, William Whiston, had recently expressed in The Eternity of Hell Torments (1740).

Through examining these issues, it contends that there are considerable benefits in thinking of life writing as being intrinsic to a far wider range of discourses than the standard biographical and autobiographical modes, arguing that a broader conception is invaluable for recovering occluded existences, modelling collective experience and understanding the hierarchies implicit in the ways in which lives are culturally inscribed.",21,"WOS:000399578600002",3
"English",,"'PIERS-PLOWMAN'; SURREY","This article explores the ways in which mid-Tudor writing addressed and imagined the city of London. Scholarly reactions to mid-Tudor writing have been mixed: where nineteenth-century editors were drawn to the anti-urban aspect of these texts, later criticism has tended to denigrate it on ethical or aesthetic grounds. This article joins recent efforts to reassess the qualities of Tudor writing by focusing on its highly emotive imagining of the city. It focuses on a 'cross-section' of mid-Tudor literature, including poetry, prose, and sermons, all produced in the period c.1542-c.1550. These number works by Robert Crowley, Henry Brinklow, Hugh Latimer, Henry Howard, Thomas Lever and John Bale. I argue that mid-Tudor writing was persistently drawn to represent England's capital in particular ways. The imagined urban landscapes of this writing are strongly biblical in nature, partly because of the continued significance of biblical rhetoric and figures in the religious landscape of the time. However, mid-Tudor writing can also be seen to focus consistently on images of the urban poor, and use a rhetorical technique of satire by listing which blurs distinctions between forms of religious and commercial invective. This sub-genre of Tudor writing also needs to be understood in terms of its rich literary debts to earlier, particularly medieval, forms of urban writing. The latter part of the essay focuses on two such debts: those of Henry Howard to Petrarch's 'Babylonion Sonnets' in the Canzoniere, and of Robert Crowley to William Langland's Piers Plowman.",79,"WOS:000422838700003",3
"English","memory; sensation; deliberation; phantasia; Thomas Aquinas",,"This article explores Thomas Aquinas's interrelated views of rhetoric and deliberation, particularly through his commentaries on Aristotle and his Summa theologiae. It argues that while articulating a largely Boethian understanding of rhetoric as consideration of uncertain matters, Aquinas also advances a theory of deliberation indebted to Aristotelian theories of sensation and phantasia. Building from previous work on phantasia in Aristotle's works, I argue that, in Aquinas's view, rhetorical deliberation is dependent on sensory information experienced through phantasia. Gathered through time and experience, sensory information serves as the foundational material for other forms of reasoning, such as deliberation and practical wisdom. In articulating Aquinas's views of rhetoric and deliberation, I suggest that the relationship between rhetoric and logic within Aquinas's system of thought be reconsidered, with rhetoric playing a prominent role in the consideration of variable and human phenomena.",34,"WOS:000404628200003",3
"English",,,"This article explores ways in which the Spanish Civil War has been represented and performed on contemporary Spanish stages, focusing analysis on three productions: Alex Rigola's 2015 adaptation of Incerta gloria by Joan Sales; Joan Olle's 2014 adaptation of Merce Rodoreda La plaza del Diamante; and Carme Portaceli's 2015 adaptation of Carmen Domingo's Nomes son dones/Solo son mujeres. I use one of the most emblematic plays to construct and explore a space for memory of the Spanish Civil War, Jose Sanchis Sinisterra's (i)Ay, Carmela! (1987), to investigate a shift in emphasis from the urge to create a space for memory to concern with how the often traumatic memories of the war and its aftermath are inscribed corporeally. I argue that in the context of contemporary discursive practice about the Spanish Civil War, the direction theatrical explorations are taking presents an opportunity for innovative reflection on the way we look at bodies in relation to events of collective violence and trauma, centring not only on the search for the bodies of the dead but also on ways in which living bodies continue to be marked by and transmit the impact of these events into the future.",74,"WOS:000409888100007",3

I argue that the novel attempts to reconfigure European history and cultural memory through a transnational, exilic perspective by exploring the British-Sudanese protagonist Yasin Zahir and his son Leo's road trip through contemporary Europe. Traveling enables Yasin to challenge official historical accounts, and envision cultural memory as fluid and dynamic. Not only does he conjure up forgotten memories of European migrants, minorities, and exiles, but he also interlinks these memories so that new solidarities can be formed across lines of ethno-cultural and/or religious division. The novel implies that only by reconfiguring the past and working through their traumatic memories can culturally hybrid individuals such as Yasin defy essentialist notions of European identity and develop a new sense of belonging.",32,"WOS:000402915400008",3
"English","Aracoeli; cognitive literary criticism; Elsa Morante; embodied mind; memory; unreliability",,"This article focuses on Elsa Morante's last novel, Aracoeli (1982), as an interesting case study of representation of the mind as embodied. The argument begins by considering the ambiguous status of Manuele as narrator and suggests that his inability to distinguish between true and apocryphal memories should be regarded as a cognitive issue rather than a rhetorical one. The next stage of the argument explores the consequences of adopting a cognitive approach, thus foregrounding the embodied mind as one of the main foci of the narrative, both thematically and stylistically. Assuming a cognitive interpretive key, the central part of the article illustrates Morante's complex portrayal of the dependence of the mind on the body and in particular on sensory perception, providing also a closer examination of the number of ways in which Morante articulates the body-mind nexus. For descriptive and heuristic purposes, these instances have been gathered into three main clusters: Embodied nature of emotions or feelings; Specificities of embodiment; and Embodied memory. Finally, I shall offer some suggestions as to how a cognitive reading of Aracoeli corroborates a non-nihilistic interpretation of the novel as expression of existential or literary defeat.",59,"WOS:000400158400010",3
"English",,,"This article focuses on how readers create characters in their imagination by drawing both on the information provided by the text and on their own emotional reactions to the story. Building on the theory of the `New Reader', as well as drawing from other disciplines such as cognitive science, the effect of textual elements on the reader is examined. A reading of Fontane's Unwiederbringlich, a novel that tells the story of two spouses who fail to bridge the gulf that opens between them, exemplifies this approach. Christine and Holk increasingly fail to understand and relate to one another with empathy, while readers are trying to comprehend, alongside them, who these characters are, why they act the way they do, and how to feel about both. The novel plays with our expectations and sympathies, subtly recreating in its readers the emotions felt by its main characters. If readers remain aware of their own process of characterisation as well as their emotional responses, they can maintain empathy with both characters instead of being drawn into identifying with only one of them. This leads to a much richer and more nuanced reading of Unwiederbringlich. Dieser Artikel untersucht, wie Leser, mithilfe der Informationen des Textes und ihren eigenen emotionalen Reaktionen darauf, fiktionale Charaktere zum Leben erwecken.

Theodor Fontanes Roman Unwiederbringlich, in welchem ein Ehepaar versucht, wieder zueinander zu finden, veranschaulicht diese Herangehensweise. Christine und Holk fallt es zunehmend schwer, einander zu verstehen und miteinander zu fuhlen, wahrend die Leser, genau wie die Protagonisten selbst, versuchen zu begreifen, wer diese Charaktere sind, was ihre Handlungen motiviert und was sie als Leser daruber denken und fuhlen. Der Roman spielt mit unseren Erwartungen und Sympathien; die Emotionen der Charaktere werden geschickt in der Leseerfahrung gespiegelt. Wenn es den Lesern gelingt, sich ihres eigenen kognitiven sowie emotionalen Charakterisierungsprozesses bewusst zu werden, konnen sie sich beiden Hauptfiguren empathisch nahern, anstatt sich mit nur einer von ihnen zu identifizieren. Dieser Ansatz eroffnet eine reichere und differenziertere Leseerfahrung von Unwiederbringlich.",19,"WOS:000398059400002",3

The figure of the child reader, I suggest, functions as one of what Charles Altieri has described as the 'projected readers' of modernism - the 'ideal' readers imagined in and constructed by modernist texts, as a way of modelling how we might respond imaginatively and psychologically to this difficult form of writing. But there is, of course, a fundamental disavowal at work in such representations of the child reader in works that are evidently not written for children to read. We, as adult readers, are solicited to identify as a child. What happens, I ask, when we do so? What is it that we are we being encouraged to identify with? Tracing the figure of the child reader through debates about difficulty, high and low culture, maturity and infantilism, in criticism and psychoanalysis, I suggest that this child reader is, crucially, an overdetermined figure. Modernism reminds us of a vestigial child in us all, but this is not an exclusionary regression imposed upon an implicitly inadequate reader by the highbrow text. Neither is this simply a fantasy of naive consolation (the child as pure identification). The child reader, I argue, opens up the vexed psychic life of reading modernism.",56,"WOS:000416544100013",3

The article seeks to prove that a reading of Agualusa's literary engagement with cultural mixtures and fluid identities will benefit from an analysis of the monstrous exaggerations that also populate this epistolary novel, since these play a role in the valorisation of creole transnationality as normal and desirable. The first part of the article reads the excessive bodies of Gabriela Santamarinha and Ana Olimpia as a canvas on which to sustain and police a vision of lusofonia as a harmonic world of creolity.

The structure of the play is a contemporary version of the theatrum mundi, insofar as the role of God, the original author of the play of human life, is now assigned to the inscrutable history, the contemporary deus absconditus. The utopian project in the play, presented as a voyage by dugout, defies history through a form of memory which Benjamin termed Eingedenken.

Treating Theosophy as a peripheral discourse of 'rejected knowledge' that stands in opposition to mainstream culture, the article discusses how Lord's distinctive reading of Ibsen reflects its grounding in this social and intellectual periphery.

These texts reveal the exhaustion of the Italian bourgeois stereotype of the fin-de-siecle woman as a devoted mother and a loyal wife, deprived of her sexual component. I examine how D'Annunzio's trilogy explores the idea of female desire through common female stereotypes, especially the progressive negation of the figure of the devoted mother. In Il piacere, female desire surfaces through the theme of adultery and is critiqued through the changes in the physical portrayal of the female protagonist and in her relationship with her daughter. In L'innocente, female sexuality is depicted instead through the medicalization of the body of the adulterous mother, physically distorted by her pregnancy. Finally, Il trionfo della morte shows female sexuality through the death of the bourgeois mother, as the female protagonist is now physically sterile and her beauty rests in her imperfect and lifeless body.",46,"WOS:000405077300011",3

Specifically, material feminism invites scholars to interrogate the mutually implicating relationships between the discursive and the material world of adolescence. Additionally, material feminism considers how the material world affects discourses about the female teenager in the overlapping areas of the body, technology, physical artifacts, and the natural world. In this formulation, identity is not a purely discursive function; it is formed in part through interactions with the material. Furthermore, philosophical interrogations of representationality elucidate the ontological gap between that which is enacted and its representation.

I investigate how this immersive gaze re-awakens the poet's sense of wonder at the material world, alerting him to the porous or 'ambient' nature of his own subjectivity, making him feel the diverse ways in which he is enmeshed in a dynamic material world and intimately exposed to its unpredictable currents of agency and affect.",19,"WOS:000405587300004",3

By using as a paradigmatic example the request for a vincolo paesaggistico in via Gluck, and by analysing a selection of articles from major Italian newspapers and two novels, namely Milano, fin qui tutto bene (2012) by Gabriella Kuruvilla and Contesa per un maialino italianissimo a San Salvario (2013) by Amara Lakhous, I argue that the threat to national identity is just a pretext and that this pattern represents an additional cog in the antiimmigration narrative.",45,"WOS:000411430700008",3
"English",,,"This article investigates William Browne's use of a poem by the medieval poet Thomas Hoccleve as a tribute to his imprisoned fellow poet George Wither. It argues that Hoccleve's self-referential poem-sequence The Series plays a wider role in Browne's poem and Wither's responses to it than has been realized. Recent scholarship has emphasized the unity of these ""Spenserian"" poets and explored their innovative uses of the pastoral genre to express public, political concerns. But Browne's Hoccleve quotation reveals the important role that satire, and its traditional interests in self-governance, played in their work, strengthening recent arguments for these poems' influence on Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy. The Spenserians used dialogic forms not simply to demonstrate consensus but to explore their differences, and rather than the poetic and political alliance that has been assumed, Browne's ambiguous tribute to Wither may have created a lasting rift. But it also had a more productive legacy in shaping Wither's turn to the psalms. Browne's Hocclevian eclogue helps to uncover the political roots of this project and of the wider prophetic identity that Wither came to assume.",93,"WOS:000391903300003",3
"English",,"COLEMAN","This article is a contribution to the study of the reception and use of the homilies of AElfric of Eynsham in the late Old and early Middle English periods, using twelfth- and thirteenth-century scribal alterations to the manuscript Cambridge, Corpus Christi College 302 as a starting point. Several characteristics of these alterations-e.g., their authors' apparent concern to provide alternatives for certain obsolescent Old English word families, their emphasis on the concepts of sin and confession, and their occasional stylistic similarities to the works of Wulfstan- are paralleled in the work of other later scribes and annotators of AElfric's homilies. Of particular interest are the marginal additions of an early-thirteenth-century scribe, who broke up one of AElfric's longer homilies into two shorter pieces by inserting a doxology and introduction into the middle of the piece. Such interventions suggest that the homilies in CCCC 302 may have continued to be read aloud to audiences long after the manuscript's composition.",56,"WOS:000411226000002",3
"English",,,"This article is a critique of the autobiographical documentary, Nelson Mandela the Living Legend (1918-2013), produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation to showcase the legendary hallmarks of former President Mandela's role in transforming South Africa from apartheid to democracy. Its central theme evolves from Mandela's portrayal as a prototype of the nefarious experiences of colonial bigotry under apartheid, a strategist in nation building and eventually providing archetypal leadership in the post-colonial period. Beyond disclosure of the underlying assumptions often associated with Mandela's classic biographical reviews, the article uses interpretative thematic frames to explicate how the autobiographical narrative epitomises the legend's astute creative intelligence in championing the transformative dialogue as an embodiment of the aspirations of South Africans. The article navigates both normative and ideological values incorporated in the content through a verbal-visual functional analysis of the main social and political actors as well as institutional contexts represented in the film. In conclusion it notes that, in addition to the content, form and organisation of the documentary, the producers successfully combined the erstwhile social, political and psychological milieu of the apartheid era with the post-apartheid democratic buoyancy. As a result, Mandela is represented as the biblical ""Moses"" imbued with the anointing to deliver the highly aspired ""miracle rainbow"" nation in the form of a democratic South Africa.",12,"WOS:000423794200006",3
"English",,,"This article is an attempt to determine possible factors that affect the arrangement of a name and the title king in apposition in the transitional period from Old English to Middle English from a prosodic perspective as a first step to explain how preferred patterns have shifted from the types represented by Alfred King, the King Alfred and Alfred the King in Old English to almost exclusively the type represented by King Alfred in Present-Day English. Contrary to the common and generally sensible judgment of avoiding poetic texts in a syntactic investigation such as this, the present study analyzes the two extant versions of La3amon's Brut, an Early Middle English metrical chronicle, on the grounds that verse may serve a better purpose than prose when intonation and rhythm are centrally involved, as is the case with this study. Use of searchable large-scale electronic corpora may at first glance seem more suitable for research of this kind, but such studies involving multiple texts of different periods, places and types are prone to oversimplification, and crucial details may be missed or glossed over. For a more detailed and coherent account of the development of appositive constructions, this study provides an in-depth analysis of the linguistic situation in a single body of closely related texts.",21,"WOS:000404975300003",3

It was interesting to see how much of contemporary indigenous reality will be identifiable in the poems collected in a single book by an author who is widely anthologised but not overwhelmingly popular in Canada. A close reading of her poetry proves that Dumont touches on many aspects of M, tis contemporary reality such as the corruption of their culture, the problem of Indian identity, the relationship between the First Nations and the White people, living conditions, gender roles, and the school system. Support for Dumont's poetic rendering of the realities of indigenous people is found in other critical works.

Apophasis is a rhetorical figure through which a speaker pretends to conceal that which he actually shows, or denies that he says or does that which he says or does.

It analyses how these narratives use the resources of the short story to challenge the colonial discourse of Lusotropicalism, dominant in Portugal in the years following the Second World War. Via the spatial and interpersonal deixis of their 'intermediate elite' protagonists, these narratives inscribe the experience of colonized subjects on the margins of the imperial capital and reflect on the dynamics of identity in their home territories.

Recent developments in museography and historiography, however, have started investigating the first steps in the creation of vast national collections of Oriental art. This paper pursues the same interrogation, but focusing instead on private collections, which may tell us more about individual motivations and tastes, the logic of acquisition of the objects, and the small circles of amateurs in which artworks and ideas were exchanged. After presenting some of the methodological difficulties of such a study, the article offers a broad survey of the various ""profiles"" of collectors of Islamic art, from the best-known connoisseurs to smaller amateurs-who may have owned just a few objects, but whose ""connected histories"" help us recreate the complex artistic and social networks involved in the diffusion of Oriental taste.

Starting out as exotic otherworldly monsters, they retained this status amongst those authors seeking to present the findings of palaeontology as consistent with the Biblical narrative of creation, while authors willing to envisage an alternative natural history of creation tended to naturalise them. By the end of the century, however, the relationship had become more complex, with authors seeking to balance similarity and otherness, and using the mix as a way of naturalising their preferred reading of the 'story' of evolutionary processes. The article thus shows how the changing relationships between the categories of 'monster', 'animal' and 'man' reflected the strategies of educators for dealing with a perceived existential crisis for man and his relationship to the natural world.",15,"WOS:000407697600003",3

I am arguing that both Chinese and American confessional poetry feature both as aesthetic categories in particular intracultural and intercultural contexts and as manifestations of personal politics. American and Chinese confessional poetry can indeed be read as a showcase of politicized self-expression at odds with established powers. The author is particularly interested in how the confessional discourse relates to the acts of self-positioning, self-defining, self-articulating, and self-interpreting and in how these Chinese and American confessional poets wrestle with politics to carve out a discursive space of their own, on the margins of the sociopolitical domain.",22,"WOS:000398392300003",3
"English","Foucault; heterotopia; space; place; contestation",,"This article looks to restore Michel Foucault's concept of the heterotopia to its literary origins, and to thereby resolve the paradox that exists between Foucault's various definitions of the term. Described by Foucault as both an unimaginable space, representable only in language, and as a kind of semi-mythical real site, examples of which include the mirror, the prison, the library, the garden and the brothel, the heterotopia seems inherently contradictory. However, through a reading of an often overlooked radio broadcast given by Foucault as part of a series on literature and utopia, this article demonstrates that the concept was never intended to refer to real urban sites, but rather pertains exclusively to textual representations of these sites. Subsequently, it looks to draw parallels between Foucault's remarks about the heterotopia and several examples of his literary criticism, on writers including Sade, Flaubert and Borges. In particular it draws attention to the similarities between Foucault's definitions of the heterotopia and the language he uses to describe the placeless places' of Blanchot's fiction, and to posit the heterotopia as an example of Blanchot's notion of literary contestation.",32,"WOS:000390995300007",3

Showing how Dante's katabasis is used to analogize the creative power of Cesaire's hellish abyss, it offers Edouard Glissant's theory of Relation as a guiding framework to emphasize fluid connectivity in Cesaire's poetic project.",27,"WOS:000417631400009",3
"English",,,"This article offers a close reading of The Order of Things by Michael Foucault and The Human Condition by Hannah Arendt, to argue that the positioning of the Human within scientific and political thought necessitates an underscoring of violence as it relates to blackness. This position interrogates how Arendt positions slavery in the Greek polis and the Roman res republica to establish her foci on modern political life. I offer an analysis of Prigg v. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as complicating Arendt's political dichotomy by shifting focus to the legal history of US American slavery. Prigg rewrites and establishes the demarcations of US Federal and State law. However, the majority opinion and dissents make fleeting reference to the fugitive slave in question, Margaret Morgan, and the possibility that she may have been sexually violated while being forcibly returned to slavery. I conclude that the contours of this case, specifically the erasure of sexual violence, demonstrate how racial slavery provides contexts to modern political life not explored by Arendt's primary concern with slavery in antiquity.",14,"WOS:000407226000005",3

Examining the rise of the figure of the creative entrepreneur as well as a range of contemporary fiction, the author argues that, to make sense of these developments and texts, we need to attend to how they reproduce the logic of finance, and in particular that of the financial instrument of the derivative. Like the financial derivative, the novels the author examines are future-oriented: they calculate and speculate on the ways they feed forward into new iterations and media. In addition, the texts and their authors are embedded within entrepreneurial networks within which different fields and competencies are brought into relation with one another.

The Prioress's opening prayer has often been read as an expression of her own personal faith, which is typically seen as infantile and anti-intellectual. Proposing that the prologue can and should be detached from this narrative voice and read against its sources, this article shows that it engages in sophisticated thinking about both the potential and the-limitations of language as a medium of prayer and praise. Chaucer combines the linguistic self-consciousness he found in Dante's Paradiso 33 with a striking confidence, grounded in the model of the liturgy, in the capacity of human language to articulate transcendent truth. Once distanced from debates about the Prioress herself, the prologue can therefore shed new light on Chaucer's critical engagement with language.",68,"WOS:000415334100004",3

Both tour accounts provide evidence of Gilpin's keen maritime interests and demonstrate that the concerns of his parish in Boldre in the New Forest, a community with close ties to the sea, significantly influence his work. Complicating the common critical assumption that Gilpin's travel writing is dominated by detached pictorialism, attention to the author's manuscript revisions to these works demonstrates the ways in which his own observations and experiences are layered with other narratives, both written and oral. The rhythms and relationships identified in Gilpin's writing reveal a complex spatial and historical understanding of the spaces of travel which transcends visual aesthetics and situates local landscapes within wider national and global contexts.",32,"WOS:000401071500006",3
"English",,,"This article offers a reading of the colonialist and ableist (audist) assumptions that undergird Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719). I argue that Crusoe's fraught experience of sound on the island serves as punishment for sins he committed in his youth (indicating the novel's audism) and that his use of gesture allows him both to manage his auditory uncertainty and to consolidate power over Friday. Through my analysis of John Bulwer's universal theory of gesture, I situate that cultural history alongside the emergence of deaf education in the eighteenth century. Reading gesture as critical to the colonial philosophy of Robinson Crusoe provides insight into travel narratives by Christopher Columbus and William Dampier, who convey that sign was used in the absence of interpreters in con tact zones. Such representations of gesture make legible colonial designs and Indigenous resistance. Gesture destabilizes Crusoe's authority even while it enables him to establish his rule.

As part of his disruptive move, Miles also removes himself from dominant forms of activity and productivity, thereby offering an image of dwelling that is not motivated by capitalist routines of labor and profit. More abstractly, Miles's form of dwelling opens up a space for thought; both characters and readers are invited to take the measure of Miles's dwelling, as well as their own. Correlatively, the text is an intricate dwelling space, offering an important and challenging phenomenological invitation to the reader to dwell within and upon the relationship between language, space, time, and thought; the text invites the reader to think about dwelling and being in contemporary society.",26,"WOS:000414066800005",3

The novels give voice to emergent subjectivities thatwhile still marginalizedare no longer subdued by dominant discourses of disavowal and exclusion. Furthermore, no longer are the struggles of non-normative characters foreshadowed by the text's preoccupation with war and security (or the lack thereof).

It focuses especially on the revival of the ancient literature of the North, and how this came to be adopted within the British literary tradition, in, for instance, such genres as the Gothic and the historical novel. The article also emphasises how British travel in the nineteenth century renewed this interest, but created a sentimental perception of the Nordic countries that caused considerable problems the moment these countries, while being perceived as a periphery, brought out a new and avant-garde literature in the late nineteenth century.

It then addresses the ubiquity of risk in everyday life in Ian McEwan's Saturday, a narrative that thematises exposure and plays on its ambivalence as both a conduciveness to danger, but also an openness to a dependence on the other. Patrick Neate's Jerusalem is then considered in the light of a principle of interdependence made possible through the trope of inter-generational trauma, and by the staging of relations of care through which exposure to risk allows for the emergence of solidarity. Finally, I turn to Jon McGregor's Even the Dogs to tease out the ways in which the evocation of precariousness and exclusion performed through specific narrative choices promotes the reader's attentiveness to new visibilities, thereby fostering the ethical and political dimensions of the novel.",28,"WOS:000396780800002",3

In Boccaccio's story, which according to the intentions of the narrator Panfilo should demonstrate the infallibility of divine action, Alatiel re-establishes' her lost virginity with a false account of her past adventures. In the first half of the fourteenth century, the topic of infallibility was closely associated with the consideration of God's omnipotence and related to the quaestio as to whether God can undo the past and restore virginity. Boccaccio borrowed from the quaestio de corrupta the motifs of chastity lost and restored, and of the possibility of erasing a past event. In this tale, parody does not issue from a reversal of the source but from abasement of the original theme: the power to annul a past event does not pertain to God, but is instead a human prerogative, which is exerted amongst humankind.",37,"WOS:000396027100003",3

"English","Ivan Vladislavi; paratext; South African book market; reception of South African literature in France","TRANSLATION","This article presents a comparative analysis of the paratexts of the French language and South African editions of a contemporary work of South African fiction by Ivan Vladislavi. The work in question is The Exploded View, translated into French by Christian Surber with the title La vue eclatee published by Swiss publisher Editions Zoe. The analysis concerns the packaging of the novels: the imagery and design of the covers - the publishers' paratexts - which are used to promote the novel in their various market contexts. The analysis reveals the South African and French versions of the novels frame the novel in different ways and take different approaches to the selling of the same' material. The cover of the South African version of The Exploded View presents the novel to South African readers as a marked departure from the overtly political themes that have dominated South African literature for decades. On the cover of the South African version, Vladislavi is hailed for exhibiting an aesthetic and thematic freshness which moves his writing beyond the traditional preoccupations of local fiction. The cover of La vue eclatee, in contrast, makes use of a quite opposite strategy. The publisher of the French version makes clear use of discourses about South Africa which have become symbolic of the country in the French imagination. The French version highlights the grand themes of racial inequality, violence, poverty, political strife and segregation and the struggle against these iniquities with which South African literature has long been inextricably associated in the French press. Neither of these approaches is a neutral representation of the content of the novel (no presentation could ever be). Both represent an intervention by the publisher to emphasise those elements of the novel which respond to the perceived mood and preoccupations of the target readers: for French readers, a continuing fascination with apartheid and its after-effects, black and white, rich and poor; for South African readers, weary of grand historical narratives and wary of simplistic binaries, a minute dissection of the contradictions, anxieties and complexities of daily lives in 21(st) century Johannesburg.",26,"WOS:000425102700004",3

"English","reporting verbs; fictional personalities; characterisation; Charles Dickens; Nicholas Nickleby; Ralph Nickleby","SPEECH","This article presents an analysis of how reporting verbs can contribute to the creation of fictional personalities in literary texts. The examination of verbs was carried out using Caldas-Coulthard's (1987) taxonomy, in which verbs are classified in self-contained categories according to the reporter's level of mediation on the words glossed. The examples under analysis were all taken from Charles Dickens's Nicholas Nickleby (1839). For the sake of consistency, I focused on one character, Ralph Nickleby, whose words are reported using twenty-six verbs a total of 501 times throughout the story. As will be shown, Dickens's choice of verbs projects a specific way of speaking that triggers information about the villain's personality, thereby contributing to shaping his well-known evil character. The analysis will also illustrate how reporting verbs can influence the way in which readers form an impression of characters on the basis of their ways of speaking during the course of a story.",37,"WOS:000418498200006",3

The article underscores how Dougherty resuscitated the public figure of Valle from a notable absence of documentation and delineated the Galician writer's undocumented relationship to the Spanish Second Republic. Second, the article meditates on the multiple theoretical frameworks that Dougherty deploys to come to terms with the complexity of Valle-Inclan's palimpsestic writing practices and magnum opus, Tirano Banderas.

Through the problematic figure of Keith, Caryl Phillips' novel explores the competing spheres of influence, migratory and otherwise, that lead to contemporary articulations of Englishness. Furthermore, the article posits that In the Falling Snow recasts familiar diasporic tropes and expands the limits of cultural memory in critically unfamiliar and even vitally post-racial ways. The narrative achieves this in part by including Eastern European migrants, whose experiences of England are circumscribed by a narrow view of Englishness. The novel therefore indexes England's vexed contemporary relationship with multiculturalism while simultaneously foregrounding the deeply rooted interconnectivity between the country and its migrant communities.

Adopting the classification offered by Johan Galtung's theory on direct, structural and cultural violence, as well as Pierre Bourdieu's theorization on symbolic violence, this essay aims at pinpointing ideological differences between Maraini's and Schiavo's narratives. In particular, it argues that, if Donna in guerra denounces direct and structural abuses on women, thus calling for institutional change, Macellum is an accusation against a cultural violence that cannot be fought with the tool of law. Maraini's and Schiavo's approaches, which mirror the standpoints of different factions of the movement of the time, are then considered in relation to Teresa de Lauretis' ideas on the structure of feminist thought and politics, in order to illustrate that both approaches are in fact essential for the subversion of violent sexist dynamics.",50,"WOS:000411430700006",3

The article considers Wynter's heretofore-neglected adaptation of Federico Garcia Lorca's La Casa De Bernarda Alba. The play appears in the newly founded Jamaica Journal in 1968, alongside an essay theorizing adaptation, production, and sets. Adaptation, for Wynter, is strategy of postcolonial reading that requires careful reinterpretation, an emphasis on historicity, and sensitivity to the imperatives of theatricality. The play evidences Wynter's concern with the politics and poetics of translation, a transformative act that exemplifies the process of indigenization theorized in her later works. Wynter transforms Lorca's original, transposing it to a Jamaican setting and adding dialogue and content to craft a scathing meditation on the legacies of colonialism.

The use of a predetermined array of genres assumes that music genres are rigid and stable concepts, whereas in reality genre boundaries continually emerge, evolve, and disappear.

We build a two-mode network of artists and respondents to identify clusters of respondents that have similar relationships to the same set of artists. Our results show that research using measurements of cultural omnivorousness based on genre preferences might be hampered, as it misses important subdivisions within genres and is not able to capture respondents who combine specific aspects within and across music genres.

Such criticism neglects women's contestations of male-dominated political and aesthetic representation in A Man of the People. Readings of that novel routinely foreground the political foibles of the unreliable narrator while overlooking how his traumatic encounter with female agency shapes his narrative.

M. Coetzee's Waiting for the Barbarians through an ecocritical lens, eschewing a postmodernist interest in a ""metaphysics of absence"" (Olsen 53) in favour of a materialist engagement with ecological presence. Readings of the novel that cite the absence of the eponymous ""barbarians"" and Empire's refusal to acknowledge this absence as a central feature of the text routinely fail to recognize the presence of ecological forces that ultimately undermine Empire's colonial project. By rectifying this critical oversight, this article's rereading avoids endowing Empire with a problematic surfeit of narrative agency; moreover, it illuminates a relationship between Empire and ecology that cannot be reduced to the simplistic terms of binary difference and is better conceptualised as a dynamic of what I call ""ecological indifference."" Finally, the article highlights parallels between the myopia of Coetzee's Empire and a brand of critical imperialism that persists in ""seeing through"" literary ecologies. In this way, Barbarians can be read as a cautionary tale for the Anthropocene.",34,"WOS:000399436200001",3

The remainder of the article proposes an alternative reading that highlights the author's intertextual borrowing from Ovid's Heroides.

"English",,,"This article reveals a central yet hitherto unsuspected meditation in Wallace Stevens on the problem of the other person in relation to the concept of the other construed by Gilles Deleuze as the ""expression of a possible world"" (1990: 308). It demonstrates that, seen from this perspective, the figure of subjectivity appears to be a rhetorical means in the service of a poetics centered on the other. In readings of Stevens, it traces the way in which he thinks through the question of the other and detects two main forms in which this is registered in the poems: the other is either associated with 'possibility', an occasion of euphoric affects, or with the foreclosure of a more fundamental reality, an 'outside', of which the other is merely a phenomenal representative and which occasions poignant affects. The reading of Stevens's late poem ""Prologues to What Is Possible"" shows that these two poles in relation to the other are juxtaposed in a paradigmatic manner.",18,"WOS:000411374400004",3

"English",,,"This article starts from the identification in French literature of a recent turn to the peripheries, at a time when the centre of Paris has become both museified and gentrified. Taking Philippe Vasset's `recit' Un livre blanc (2007) as a case study of this turn, this article identifies urban peripheries as the space where the postcolonial and the postindustrial intersect, intensifying the precarity of those who live there. The analysis proceeds dialectically to unfold the ways in which Vasset both resorts to the neutralizing spatialism operated by cartography and distances himself from these postmodern coordinates, deploying a `poetics of precarity' that encodes the unstable qualities of the peripheries. Arguing that neither of the two concepts currently used to define contemporary space - the lieux de memoire and the non-lieux - is fully apt to describe the current socio-temporal configurations of urban peripheries, this article elaborates the concept of `precarious spaces', redirecting the analysis towards the political pressures exerted by the globalized, fragile dimensions of our contemporary moment.

"English","Patronage; authorship; economic aspects; autonomy; literary markets",,"This article suggests that patronage relationships can be interpreted in terms of gift exchange, arguing that this pertains in particular to late nineteenth-century forms of patronage. Patronage relationships in this period had a reciprocal nature and were characterised by a certain degree of instability. Since literary patronage had to redefine its position in a field that was becoming ever more commercial, benefactors and beneficiaries were both looking for new ways of fulfilling their role and subtly negotiated their share in influence and power. These changes were caused by developments affecting artistic practice and autonomy: paradoxically, in this period patronage was not so much a threat to the independence of artists as one of the conditions and driving forces for their increased autonomy. Focussing on the 1860s and 1870s, the author examines three patronage circles: one led by a writer-patron, the other by a writer-beneficiary and the third by a salon hostess offering a platform to numerous authors. Their negotiations will be interpreted through an adaptation of gift theory.",40,"WOS:000396175700004",3

Since natural emotions were understood to be contaminated by original sin, preachers saw it as important that their sermons teach their audiences how to feel godly emotions, emotions that the preacher himself was supposed to feel as he preached. The sermon genre, therefore, offers a mimetic theory of the emotions to its hearers and readers, a theory that we can understand more fully through the concept of intersubjectivity. By reading or hearing a sermon, individuals could understand themselves as constituted within a faithful and feeling community of Christian believers, and selfhood itself as defined by the process of relating one's inside views and emotions to outward experiences and teaching.",32,"WOS:000418057200003",3

While laudable, the crucial aim of recent critics, to elucidate the relationship between literary text and social context, is in practice often compromised by the notion that literary works are more valuable if they can be shown somehow to predate or prefigure our own historical situation. This notion, however, is itself an article of faith, and needs to be critically examined if ideological analysis is to retain its productivity. To that end, the present article suggests that literary criticism would do well to focus not so much on the literary text as on the literary situation, which involves not only the writer and the original audience of the text, but its subsequent readings as well.",60,"WOS:000406981900001",3

In this article, I explore Musil and Schmitt's elective affinities by examining the critique of historical idealism to be found in Musil's Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften as well as in Schmitt's short satire Die Buribunken, which ironize the universal pretensions of the world spirit. I argue that Musil and Schmitt were both aware of the act of exception at work in the order of the law, the leap of faith that demands the suspension of one sphere for the priority of another.

"English","editing; canon; attribution; authorship; apocrypha",,"This article takes the contested relationship between the Christian canon and the Apocrypha in early modern England as a model for understanding three recent editions of Shakespeare's works. A Shakespeare Apocrypha found its first formal instantiation in C. F. Tucker Brooke's collection in 1908. Brooke's belief that there may be fragments of Shakespeare's writing among the apocryphal drama, but that such instances are neither ""Shakespearian"" nor warrant inclusion among Shakespeare's works, poses a question for recent work by attributionists that have identified Shakespeare's hand beyond the bounds of the traditional canon. Over the past 30 years, series and editions of Shakespeare's drama have introduced more plays, changing the canon. Three recent Complete Works, the Royal Shakespeare Company edition, the third edition of the Norton Shakespeare and the New Oxford Shakespeare each reproduce Shakespeare's works in two different forms or editions, with a complete works supplemented by another body of texts. The relationships between the constituent editions echo many of the uncertainties between canon and Apocrypha contested in Shakespeare's time. Analysing the tensions between the proto-and deuterocanonical collections of Shakespeare reveals the contingent nature of the canon and should occasion a rethinking of what we mean by Shakespeare's works.",63,"WOS:000423221000002",3

Through a comparative reading of Zakes Mda's The Madonna of Excelsior (2002) and Gerald Kraak's Ice in the Lungs (2006), the article examines how apartheid's Immorality Act functioned as the legislative mechanism to produce and police heteronormative whiteness. The randomness and unpredictability of sexual desire in both historical novels expose the tenuousness of this idealised heteronormative whiteness that lay at the centre of the apartheid project. Situated within the moral panic and political turmoil of the 1970s, the novels identify sex as a powerful lens through which to read the history of apartheid. While Mda's satirical novel focuses on transgressive interracial sexual desire, Kraak's realist text explores same-sex desire and intimacy. My reading of the two novels engages with the political history of apartheid's sexual policing and insists on the inextricable entanglement of its heteronormative and racial supremacist provisions. The traditional ideological centrality of the vulnerable white woman is displaced in the novels by white men whose transgressive sexual desires for black women (in Mda's novel) and other white men (in Kraak's) refuse the certainty and naturalness of heteronormative whiteness.",38,"WOS:000406439000007",3

Second, we explore how this tension between difference (distance) and closeness (proximity) is discursively and narratively constructed by young unemployed people in Greece who wrote and shared narratives of desired future selves.

The project demonstrates that, in each film, colonial stereotypes of black hypersexuality and savagery are initially presented as a campy portrayal of Spanish patriarchy, but are then problematically resignified as a symbol of gender and sexual fluidity. However, because the discourse of blackness in the films recreates a triangular, transatlantic relationship between Spain, Africa and the New World, the campy resignification of colonial stereotypes produces a ghostly ambivalence that the films cannot resolve. Instead, the films reveal themselves to be haunted by the memory of slavery and colonialism, thereby calling attention to the contested role that colonialism and its loss have played in the formation of modern Spanish national identity.",46,"WOS:000417502200001",3

"English","early modern drama; collaboration; revision; editing; canon; complete works",,"This contribution takes stock of recent editorial endeavours to expand the Shakespearean canon and discusses how admitting plays of collaborative and/or uncertain authorship slowly but steadily erodes the idea of ""completeness"". The New Oxford Shakespeare serves as an important test case: instead of promoting a holistic approach to Shakespeare's oeuvre (as championed by T.S. Eliot, among others), the editors of the new Complete Works encourage lateral reading and bolder speculation concerning various modes of collaborative and revisory authorship. As greater integration of texts once orbiting the Shakespearean canon at a ""safe"" distance is one of the more ambitious aims of this edition, it is perhaps unfortunate to find that some of these texts have not been included in their entirety - only the supposedly Shakespearean passages are to be found in Complete Works - and so cannot fully support the revisionist agenda. Instead, ""the more Shakespeare, the better"" seems to be a pertinent motto (apt also for the editorial policy universally preferring longer early texts over shorter ones). Searching for Shakespeare in the plays of his colleagues might, however, ultimately yield only limited rewards and an approach replacing a single author with a playing company as an organising principle of a Complete Works edition is proposed as a more promising way forward.",10,"WOS:000423221000003",3

The main goal is to explore the influence exerted by the of-PP on verb number. To this end, syntactic factors, such as the plural morphology of the oblique noun (i.e., the noun in the of-PP) and syntactic distance, as well as semantic issues, such as the animacy or humanness of the oblique noun within the of-PP, were analysed. The data show the strongly conditioning effect of plural of-dependents on the number of the verb: they favour a significant proportion of plural verbal forms. This preference for plural verbal patterns, however, diminishes considerably with increasing syntactic distance when the of-PP contains a non-overtlymarked plural noun such as people. The results for the semantic issues explored here indicate that animacy and humanness are also relevant factors as regards the high rate of plural agreement observed in these constructions.",25,"WOS:000404460200002",3

The essay takes its lead from recent attempts to recover the significance of Hegel's aesthetics for thinking about modern and contemporary art (J.M. Bernstein's Against Voluptuous Bodies and Robert Pippin's After the Beautiful, above all), but notes that Hegel's consideration of the materiality of poetry is especially intractable, given that poetic material, language, is not as straightforwardly material as canvas, paint, stone, and wood may be taken to be. The essay shows that both recent interpreters of Hegel's aesthetics and commentators on his theory of poetry in particular have somewhat stinted the complexity of his view of poetry's materials.

I situate Melville's Typee and Pierre within an emergent nineteenth-century discourse of privacy, still prevalent today, in which one's private life operates to develop and display one's adherence to conventional public morality.

While the malleability of the fetal entity lends itself toward zoetropes, arguably all subjects are made zoetropologically. To be tropologically animated, or given life, means immediate absorption into a biopolitical field of regulation. Humanhood is among the most consequential of biopolitical thresholds through which an entity can be zoetroped.

"English","cultural narratology; negotiation; circulation; Pierre Bourdieu; Lemony Snicket","CIRCULATION; PYNCHON","This essay aims to clarify how literary and nonliterary narratives function in society and culture. To reach this broad goal, it first presents a general framework inspired by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu and the American New Historicist Stephen Greenblatt. The framework centers on the notions of circulation and negotiation. Stories circulate from one field to another, thereby transporting and transforming narrative templates that belong to these fields. Stories negotiate these templates and in so doing invite readers to activate and negotiate their own narrative habitus. The second part of the essay compares the proposed theory of narrative in culture to existing narrative theories about circulation and negotiation and to the traditional model of narrative as a form of communication, which it tries to overcome. Finally, the essay offers a detailed analysis of The Lump of Coal (2008) by Lemony Snicket. The analysis shows that stories can be interpreted as ways of circulating and negotiating narrative templates on three levels. First, the plot of the text itself can be read as a circulation of elements taken from various domains mentioned in the story (especially art, nutrition, economy, and religion). Second, there is circulation and negotiation between the text and the paratext (including the blurb and the illustrations on the dust jacket), and third, the text negotiates and circulates contextual elements, more specifically templates, such as generic patterns, ethnic stereotypes, and commonsense morality.",79,"WOS:000425196000001",3

While the play text empowers its female dancers, most twentieth- and twenty-first-century performances have limited their authority and made the dance into a scene that highlights the oppression of women.

It was also a way to conform to the government's criminalisation of the Indian press for expressions of disaffection'; by professing its allegianceto East-West friendship, but demonstrating the fallacy of this idea in practice through its juxtaposition of articles by British and Indian writers, the journal gives us insight into the changing valences of cosmopolitanism over the period of its circulation; the way syncretism mediated between these valences; and how these discourses were shaped by the regulation of the press.",55,"WOS:000401448100007",3

Notwithstanding the importance of a critique on human rights violations, the article points to the unwanted but very real side effects the current mediatisations of violence have, from structural victimisation and the creation of gay martyrs' to the resignification of the West as progressive and gay' and Russia as backward and heterosexual. A close reading of popular press photographs of wounded Russian gay youth and the textual context - arguably representative for the Western media focus on the Eastern' violation of human rights between 2012 and 2014 - serves to illustrate how an image of Russian nation and Russian state politics is forged within Anglophone media discourses meant to reinforce the positive identity of the self-same by evoking pity, empathy and a responsible helpful attitude toward the endangered othered. The essay argues that Anglophone media's focus on the vulnerability of Russian LGBTIQ+ bodies, consciously or unconsciously, reduces the subjects to this vulnerability, confirming feelings of moral superiority within the enlightened audience. The study highlights the important role that Russia's vulnerable citizens play not only in the construction of values such as tolerance' and acceptance' and evaluations like progressive' and modern', but also in perceptions of the nation and its people and the reaffirmation of the dualistic divide between The East' and The West'.",55,"WOS:000415979000004",3

The optative shapes Trollope's novels in two ways: first, as the main determinant of character psychology and behavior; and second, as a structural principle that governs his handling of the multiplot novel. Through an analysis of The Small House at Allington (1864)-the first of Trollope's novels in which the plot is fully motivated by psychological characterization-I show how Trollope adopts narrative strategies of fragmentation and development to distribute optative motifs across the character-space, in effect replicating at the level of structure what takes place within individual minds. In this way, Trollope finds formal means for staging the contest between freedom and contingency in the construction of the self, significantly advancing the character-plot debate of the 1860s and deepening the moral purpose of his realism.",45,"WOS:000399066000003",3

It specifically focuses on two non-canonical texts by women writers, Mary Hallock Foote's 1896 novella, ""The Harshaw Bride,"" and Honore Willsie Morrow's 1923 novel, The Exile of the Lariat-two works that engage with this theme in order to draw attention to the roles that women played in modernizing the West. This paper discusses how Foote and Morrow contradicted the electrical industry's depiction of electrical development as a solely masculine endeavor. It also demonstrates that both writers perpetuated stereotypes about native women in their attempts to emphasize the contributions of white women. By recovering these novelizations of electricity in the West, this essay ultimately challenges the prevailing idea that western writers were anti-modern, chronicling instead the complex feelings that men and women had about social and technological changes to their way of life.",34,"WOS:000409160000004",3
"English",,,"This essay argues that in its revisions of the sentimental genre, Herman Melville's Pierre frames religious domesticity as dangerous for antebellum families. Whereas heroines of sentimental fiction model moral perfection, Pierre Glendinning teaches readers through a negative example of piety. Though Pierre appears to make a great sacrifice on behalf of another when he feigns marriage to his would-be sister Isabel Banford, his Christian belief is actually self-centered. Pierre holds his singular interpretations of biblical morality above the moral lessons of mothers, ministers, and literature, places where sentimental characters would typically seek guidance. Ultimately, Pierre's inflexible faith and rigid moral compass destroy the novel's domesticity. Christian belief, rather than serving as the foundation for a stable home life, tears the Glendinnings apart, and the whole family dies by the novel's ending. However, I argue that Melville's attention to reading practices throughout the novel helps us to reevaluate its seemingly-apocalyptic ending. Through a fresh look at the significance of Plinlimmon's pamphlet, I locate the possibility for a new future, one which would center on secular domesticity.",31,"WOS:000415388100005",3

"English","Marilynne Robinson; quiet; contemporary fiction; philosophical quietism; Gilead","APOLOGY","This essay argues that Marilynne Robinson's Gilead novels embody a quiet aesthetic of narrative that has emerged as a vibrant trend in the early years of the twenty-first century. Robinson's fiction is not driven by the narratological noise of action, event, and plot but by the internal machinations of consciousness, a reinvention of modernist themes that is also a return. By reading for quiet in Robinson's work, this essay therefore demonstrates how the Gilead trilogy challenges the dominance of trauma narratives in contemporary American fiction and privileges the representation of quiet people, places, and states above the wider noise associated with Western culture.",84,"WOS:000393800900003",3

Digestion was a vital part of nineteenth-century conversations about the mind-body relationship. Physicians and itinerant dietary reformers alike held that the state of the mind mirrored the state of the stomach: to manage one's digestion was to safeguard one's mind against debility and madness. I argue that Moby-Dick depicts digestion as a powerful psychological force and an assertive check to contemporary philosophical hopes of transcending bodily limitations. Ultimately, the novel's depiction of digestion yields new ways of thinking about embodiment in both Moby-Dick and the mid-nineteenth century generally.",41,"WOS:000397138900007",3

It is through the subject of abortion, which circulated with high visibility in advertisements and other printed material in antebellum New England cities, that The Scarlet Letter's attention to such concepts as adultery, birth, life, and citizenship finds new and ironic force. Hester Prynne's characterization as her community's scapegoat, moreover, aligns with reports about the scandalous midwife-abortionist Madame Restell that circulated in the press throughout the 1840s.",45,"WOS:000396804700002",3
"English",,,"This essay argues that Orwell's representation of animals as companion species offers a strikingly new, as-yet largely neglected view of animal agency and interiority in his work. In ""Shooting an Elephant"", Burmese Days and ""Marrakech"", the writer's focus on the social reject is supplemented by a marked sense of community implying human tragedy yet framing it within precariously situated human-animal, colonial or urban-imperial transitions that visualise animals as agents of change and co-shaping species interdependent with the lives of the humans that utilize and domineer them. Animals are required whenever Orwell aspires to shift from isolation to communality, from the self-conscious outsider to the larger realm of ideas framing the world in which his characters strive to overstep the accepted lines of social performance and conformity. Read in and around disciplinary structures of rationalization, Orwell's animals appear to secure themselves, quite paradoxically, a place within the normative anthropocentric framework excluding them. They extend beyond anthropomorphising or allegorical modes of description and open up bio-political perspectives within and across regimes of knowledge and empathy. Orwell's writings thus present a challenge to the culturally accredited fantasy of human exceptionalism, collapsing any epistemic space between humans and animals and burying the idea of sustaining radical species distinction.",30,"WOS:000411374400002",3
"English","George Eliot; The Mill on the Floss; sympathy; economics; fetishism",,"This essay argues that steam and its gaseous properties in George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss (1861) represent capital's increasing abstraction in the nineteenth century that threatened to disrupt economic and affective relations between people, property, and places associated with the past while nevertheless introducing new modes of circulation and more diffusive opportunities for sympathetic connection. The novel's return to an earlier stage in the development of capital places the 1830s of the story in dialogue with the 1860s of its narration, while inviting readers to compare the values of this earlier period to those of their own. Considering this comparative structure in relation to nineteenth-century ethnography and its interlocutors-including Auguste Comte, Ludwig Feuerbach, and Karl Marx-I read Edward Tulliver's primitive materialism and the Dodson sisters' fetishism as both humorous reactions and more earnest forms of resistance to this increasing abstraction. Eliot ultimately turns toward the figurative possibilities of sublimation as a way to bridge the concrete and the abstract, the particular and the general, will and affect, self and other. Sublimation-not liquidation-therefore serves as the more apt metaphor for sympathy in the novel.",55,"WOS:000425259700003",3

Their poems show how the category of the everyday is a scene where political meanings can be discerned: poems can be built out of rather ordinary encounters and experiences. Fanailova and Medvedev seek to make visible previously unnoticed aspects of experience, and to engage in forms of political speech based on personal interactions, economic transactions, and sexual encounters. The essay draws on theoretical work that ties poetic subjectivity to an emerging idea of freedom (Jacques Ranciere), or that links personal evolution to ethics (Stanley Cavell).",41,"WOS:000401045000011",3
"English","Anthropocene; extinction; future memory; narrative; science; literature","CLIMATE","This essay argues that the growing awareness of anthropogenic climate change and of the possibility of human extinction has begun to alter the very function of narrative; understood as a mode of knowledge, and as a technology through which cultural knowledge is archived in the present, narrative no longer only serves as a way of (cognitively) organising and emplotting human experience, but also as a way of (affectively) apprehending the end of possible human life. The essay develops this argument through a discussion of one of the most popular tropes in the Anthropocene imagination: that of a future reader who, in an imagined future, reads the remains of contemporary existence. Drawing on an archive of contemporary and of popular science writing, the essay argues that this future reader takes two different disciplinary forms: as a historian who chronicles historical errors that she, unlike us, is able to appreciate, or as an archaeologist who will be left to read mankind's geological footprint after its extinction. While the former, historical mode conforms to a traditional use of narrative, the second, geological one points up the anxieties, desires, and uncertainties besetting the anticipation of human extinction - here routed through the imagining of a radically nonhermeneutic and nonhuman form of registration.",43,"WOS:000403784300002",3
"English","Charles Dickens; Bleak House; trust; Realism; epistemology",,"This essay argues that the narrative structure of Charles Dickens's Bleak House (1852-1853), which repeatedly shifts from the omniscient narrator's skeptical stance to Esther's trusting disposition, demonstrates how skepticism is ultimately grounded in an epistemology of trust. Trust constitutes a non-skepticist, affective attitude whose certitude in the phenomenal world is not subject to demonstrative proof. The latter model of trust is not only fundamental to epistemology, but also to ethical relations and practical life. The important role that trust plays in everyday life also poses relevance to our understanding of realist representation. Using Bleak House as its novelistic example, this essay considers ""realism as a mode that achieves its effect by inviting readers to adopt an attitude of trust. Such an account runs counter to traditional epistemologies of realism, which have typically aligned it with post-Cartesian skepticism.",84,"WOS:000404083200003",3

Unlike her husband, Guildeluec acts on sympathy formed through contemplation, rather than on her own desires, and does so using knowledge she gains by observing the natural world.

To make this argument, it looks at the shifting definition of masculinity in the 1970s by analyzing the increased visibility of homosexual subcultures in the mainstream and by examining how the men's magazine Esquire (the original place of publication for Answered Prayers) responded to these shifting gender norms. Having established this historical and cultural context, the essay develops an analysis of Answered Prayers in conversation with twenty-first-century Capote scholars who have sought to unveil and analyze the political dimensions of Capote's persona and his writing, especially in relation to cultural norms of sexuality, conformity, and consumption. The essay then turns to the role of queer spaces in Answered Prayers to demonstrate how Capote critiques the relationship between economic and masculine domination.",72,"WOS:000414066800003",3
"English","Dandy; Dandyism; Quentin Crisp; Self-portrait; Michel Beaujour; Gay and lesbian studies",,"This essay argues that, although he is often characterized as aristocratic and defiant, the literary dandy fundamentally is the object of the types of violence identified by Galtung: direct, structural, and cultural. These three kinds can be traced throughout dandyism's history, from the historical rise of ""Beau"" Brummell to more contemporary literary theorizing, as matters of acknowledging direct violence's common proximity to the dandy, noting the dandy's strong structural connection to his modern celebrity analogue, and understanding how the dandy transforms the economic and cultural relations of the commodity. Each of these aspects serve to reduce the literary dandy to a state of abjection. As a result of this antagonism, author and literary dandy Crisp adopts a form of life-writing in his memoir The Naked Civil Servant that can be identified as the literary self-portrait, a confessional and contrarian sub-genre theorized by Beaujour. The authorship of the self-portrait, then, serves as a defensive tactic that rewrites and reinterprets the violence of the dandy's opponents.",43,"WOS:000400571400018",3

While Washington relied on a closed-market model that situated him as the spokesperson for an otherwise silent black community, Du Bois worked to create opportunity for deliberation among a number of black publics, and Du Bois's more democratically minded rhetorical modeling offers a version of public-intellectual work that resonates with the needs of the current moment.",39,"WOS:000399461000002",3

"English","Indian childhood; Indian girlhood; cultural homogenisation; childhood studies",,"This essay attempts to map historical, literary and social constructions of childhood in India and to explore ways in which these differ from Western-dominated, globalised attitudes to childhood. Evidence about Indian childhood is drawn from across a narrative spectrum including children's books and films and some adult writing and media. Notions of childhood are different within and across the cultures of the world; while there is no 'correct' version of childhood, many have common features and sometimes the influences of one culture can be strongly felt in another. In India, for example, a dominant construction of childhood was imported through Western education.(1) After Independence (1947), Indian children's literature in English became caught up in the mass postcolonial project of nation-building. As part of becoming emancipated from colonial rule, a dominant image of the child in fiction based on Western childhood had to be replaced by one that is hybrid and multicultural. This construction of Indian childhood is now itself being buffeted by forces of cultural homogenisation.(2)",38,"WOS:000403469800006",3

"English","Architectural meta-language; chorography; chronotope; ""metamorphic"" staging; Titus Andronicus; Julius Caesar; Othello; Sejanus; Macbeth",,"This essay begins by examining the relative paucity of Early Modern architectural meta-language in Shakespeare's work. Moving on, it considers a number of instances (including Othello and Julius Caesar) in which Shakespeare steers his drama away from the more ""realistic"" forms of architectural representation increasingly favoured by masque-makers like Jonson and his peers. An interim finding here is that by contrast with the increased ""fixing"" of space brought about by new scenographic developments in the period, Shakespeare tends to opt for a more flexible ""metamorphic"" style of architectural staging which maximises the affordances of the limited resources available within Elizabethan and early Jacobean popular theatres. Shakespeare's basic modus operandi, it is contended, is to exploit consensus with the audience about what is being viewed to in order to ""thicken"" the sense of architectural space. Taking its cue from Anne Myers, the following section then turns to examine Shakespeare's engagement with chorography, as exemplified by the rich constellation of relevant images from Macbeth which have sustained much of the atmosphere of the play as it has travelled through the centuries. Finally-having looked in more detail at the reciprocal relationship between the development of chorography and architecture in early modern Britain-the essay closes by considering ways in which ""architecturalised"" versions of Shakespeare's text may have contributed to the perpetuation of the chorological aesthetic in the Gothic novel and the chronotope of the castle.",74,"WOS:000405720800002",3

"English",,,"This essay calls for a reconsideration of what has been termed ""the poetry of witness."" Typically, discussions of witness poetry have privileged a poet's physical proximity to the events written about. Even after the 9/11 attacks, an event that arguably produced witnesses around the world, a poet's authority has continued to rest on her having physically encountered extremity. This essay looks to the American poet Juliana Spahr's 2005 collection, This Connection of Everyone with Lungs, for the rewards of re-assessing long held conceptions of witnessing and proximity. Spahr responds to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent war in Iraq. Her witness position is constructed not through proximity to extremity but through distance both physical and critical from it. Spahr's project expands a definition of witness as it suggests that witnessing disaster is an inevitable and inevitably shared part of living in the globalized world.",65,"WOS:000402221600008",3
"English",,,"This essay challenges the assumption that Henry Fielding hated Methodism by taking an in-depth look at Fielding's treatment of Methodism in his Joseph Andrews. A comparison between Fielding's treatment of the faith ""versus"" works controversy in Joseph Andrews and coverage of the controversy in contemporary sermons, both Latitudinarian and Methodist, points out the inadequacies of language in these kinds of debates. The emerging genre of the novel, which provided a receptive ear to nuance in language, was thus an ideal vehicle for the expression of Fielding's Latitudinarian doubt. Joseph Andrews allowed Fielding the creation of Parson Adams, a fictional character whose views on Methodism and George Whitefield are not, as is generally alleged, necessarily representative of Fielding's views. In choosing to name Parson Adams after the biblical Abraham, or the Father of the Faithful, Fielding is not only questioning the parson's privileging of works and reason over faith, but also declaring his skepticism of the Latitudinarian privileging of works and reason. Perhaps Parson Adams's polemicist rant against ""enthusiasm"" is Fielding's attack on a shallow interpretation of justification by faith alone rather than a full-fledged attack upon the doctrine itself. Though it is often treated as Fielding's opportunity to be satirical, the parson's ineffectiveness, which can be seen as representative of the larger ineffectiveness of the Anglican Church, is a serious matter.",31,"WOS:000413904900007",3

Interrogating their respective primitivist approaches to pre-capitalist cultural systems (Pound's to a medieval arcadia before usury and Bataille's to ancient Aztec and North American tribal societies), it draws attention to unexpected convergences between the writers' political and economic ideas. The author demonstrates that Pound - a supporter of Mussolini's fascist state - was, by the use-value basis of his economics, in many ways closer to Marx than the expressly Marxist Bataille. Although Pound shared Bataille's preference for pagan and Catholic splendour' over Protestant thrift, as well as his belief that sexual repression and puritanical fear were contributors to a blockage in the system, his economic approach ultimately abhorred the Nietzschean squander' celebrated in Bataille's The Accursed Share. The essay ends by using the two writers to shed light on the literary-philosophical conditions that incubated fascism, as well as the perversely depoliticising and dangerous effects of interpreting the economy according to metaphysical truths'.

Focusing on Eno's so-called 'ambient' music, the essay asks to what extent this work can be read as an aesthetic intervention in contemporary cultures of musical listening that are driven and shaped by the instantaneous availability of music in digital formats. His sound installation 12 Seasons, written for the 'Great Gallery' of the Palace of Venaria Reala in Turin, is marked by slowly evolving melodic structures and textures that imply a culture of sustained listening. However, the installation process also saw Eno personally involved in the adaptation of the pre-recorded music to the acoustic properties of the gallery: this created a listening experience that could only be fully appreciated in the space for which the music was composed, given that the sound evolved as visitors moved through the gallery. Examining Eno's compositional technique, installation practice and its underpinning musical theory, the essay asks to what extent 12 Seasons and similar works offer a spatially variable listening experience, which critiques the present trend of accessing music through lo-fidelity digital files and re-enforces the need for attentive listening over extended time.

"English",,"EARLY PHOTOGRAPHY; POE,EDGAR,ALLAN","This essay contributes to existing scholarly research on Poe's relationship with photography by focusing on his metaphorical references to daguerreotypy. While Poe's essays on this art and his personal sessions with daguerreotypists have inspired numerous articles, his tales about daguerreotypy have not been studied closely as such because they allude to it figuratively. After the daguerreian discovery in 1839, Poe's fictional works repeatedly depicted an anxious urge in antebellum society to use the art as a rationalized magic for visually preserving the dead in a lifelike manner. His literary interests in reincarnation and the living dead manifest as portraits in a daguerreian discourse, with singular, lifelike, and even grotesquely real effects-precisely like postmortem photographs.

"English",,,"This essay deals with the visual characterization of men as animals in the work by Jason (degrees 1965, Norway), a nomadic artist working in-between various cultural traditions. Typical of his comics is the spare, dear-line style and the systematic representation of human characters with animal faces. The first part contextualizes various aspects of Jason's use of animal faces, such as minimalism in comics and its relationship with the general strand of constrained writing. The second part of the essay contains a reading of The Left Bank Gang, a 2006 comics in which Jason evokes the subculture of American/Anglophone writers in exile in Paris during the 1920s. In the alternate world he imagines, Pound, Fitzgerald, Stein, Hemingway, Joyce, and others are however portrayed not as writers, but as graphic novelists, all of them being moreover 'animals'. The article focuses on issues of representation and discusses how the use of animal masks works as a constraint that opens up new possibilities for both a reflection on identity and graphic storytelling.",15,"WOS:000424066400005",3

Its central point is that the assertion advanced by some critics that the novel's relationship with television comprises part of Thomas Pynchon's critique of mass media, a critique aimed at distancing the literary novel from more popular forms, must be rethought in light of the fact that The Crying of Lot 49 is more deeply indebted to and interpenetrated by the strategies and formal features of early broadcast television than previous readings have been able to show.",18,"WOS:000415658200002",3
"English","digital narrative; narrative space; Mikhail Bakhtin; chronotope; distant reading",,"This essay describes the way that digital narratives (both commercial video games and electronic literature) create two kinds of space: a primary storytelling space in which gameplay or reading occurs, and an orientating space through which those primary spaces are encountered. This orienting space might include a larger narrative world, a menu from which game options can be chosen, or some expressive frame for our reading and play. This essay examines space in narrative theory especially the work of Ruth Ronen, Gabriel Zoran, David Herman, and Mikhail Bakhtin in search of a theory able to accommodate this orienting space. After an analysis of the challenges of accounting for intentionally bounded or limited narrative space in these theories, this essay turns to Bakhtin's under-appreciated distinction between the view from inside and outside of the chronotope, which offers an account of what it would mean to occupy such an orienting space. This essay concludes by arguing that the methodology adopted here can have a wider application. By treating a new medium as offering possibilities that reveal unrecognized tensions and limitations within older theories, this essay describes a kind of narratological archeology similar to recent work on media archeology.",37,"WOS:000390973900006",3

On the basis of this contrast, it suggests that the postcolonial and transnational publics interpellated by the novels are sometimes different from the audiences or readers dramatized in the texts.

"English",,,"This essay discusses the contribution to overcoming dualism made by eighteenth-century anthropology. Anthropology in this period is a hybrid discourse comprising elements of popular philosophy, physiognomy, and psychology, which among other things aims to fill the gap left by the perceived failure of abstract, a priori, and transcendental approaches to philosophy either to ground knowledge in any absolute sense or guide us in more everyday questions of knowledge and action. It is associated with a holist approach to the 'whole man' and with a naturalist epistemology that prefers description to speculation. This article argues that an important strand of anthropology's holism involves consciously turning away from dualist ontologies. In a way that is anticipated in animist and vitalist approaches to human ontology (which are important aspects of medical science in the period), this dualism is displaced by, firstly, an attitude that is motivated by practical concerns, reflecting the close relationship between anthropological thinking and medicine in the late eighteenth century, and, secondly, a heuristic focus on effects rather than absolute definitions and ultimate causes. This heurism is thus at odds with an understanding of anthropology as adhering simply to naturalist positivism.",45,"WOS:000415686600003",3

"English","intertextuality; Kant; Kleist; media theory; Shakespeare; translation",,"This essay draws on media archaeology and the history of translation in order to challenge two arguments that have long shaped interpretations of Heinrich von Kleist and German Romanticism: (1) that Kleist wrote in reaction to Kant and (2) that Shakespeare's plays provided a model of naturalness to poets of theGoethezeit. By placing Kleist's letters in conversation with the material history of the optical media to which they frequently allude, I suggest that his crisis centers on how media mediate perception and representation. Moreover, I propose that Kleist's performance of crisis takes its cues fromHamlet. After closely reading several essays where Kleist invokes Shakespeare in order to argue for a middling aesthetic, I return to Christoph Martin Wieland's and A. W. Schlegel's translations ofHamlet to demonstrate that the play hailed as a mirror held up to nature in fact constantly foregrounds the non-transparency or mediated quality of perception and communication. Finally, by examining Kant'sDreams of a Spirit Seer (1766), I show how Kleist's hamletisch concerns haunt the discourse of German Idealism from within. My broader ambition is to demonstrate how untimely reading across languages and media might break open the discourse networks and historical periods that continue to structure studies of literature, even in the work of scholars who claim to depart from old orders of knowledge.",29,"WOS:000395070500002",3
"English",,,"This essay draws on the enduring nature of Maurice Barre's's canonization of Marie Bashkirtseff as 'Notre-Dame du sleeping-car' in 1890 as the basis for an investigation into the configuration of genre, gender, and train travel in Marie Bashkirtseff's Journal. It argues that by following through the allusions to scandal that were deleted from the 1887 edition of the Journal, a link emerges between Bashkirtseff's precarious social status and her constant geographical mobility. Bashkirtseff's exclusion from those social sites that were constitutive of feminine gentility resulted in a pattern of train travel and diary-writing that unravelled both the logic of return underpinning the journal de voyage, and the protocols of femininity that propelled Bashkirtseff into diary-writing in the first place. It is argued that Bashkirtseff's simultaneous locomotive travel and assiduous diarizing makes her diary not just a source of data on train travel, but rather the point of intersection of two nineteenth-century technologies: the journal de jeune fille as the means by which young girls in the late nineteenth century whiled away the long years before marriage, and locomotion, as a means of shifting the subject through the landscape, more directly and far faster than before. Bashkirtseff draws on each in order to 'fill in' the other - diarizing as a means of whiling away the time she spends in the train, and train travel as the stuff of her diary entries.",30,"WOS:000400924400002",3
"English","Ian McEwan; Atonement; British novel; FR Lewis; postmodernism","IAN MCEWANS ATONEMENT","This essay emerged from the intersection of two texts: a 2009 article by Alistair Cormack claiming that Ian McEwan's Atonement (2001) was a rejection of postmodernism in favor of a return to F.R. Leavis's ""Great Tradition,"" and the protagonist Briony's closing question: ""What are novelists for?"" This essay criticizes the ongoing legacy of Leavis's association of literature and moral improvement, an argument still being recycled today by critics like Harold Bloom and Martha Nussbaum, by tracing McEwan's long history of interrogating this presumed ethical link in his fiction. Far from affirming Leavis's position, McEwan's work shows that some of humanity's worst atrocities have coincided with its greatest periods of education and literacy. Rather than a moral phenomenon, the concluding section of the essay draws on the recent work of Nancy Armstrong, among others, to argue that the novel reflects the production of a peculiarly modern form of subjectivity that allows Atonement, by combining postmodern strategies with references to seminal texts from the British tradition (Richardson, Fielding, Burney, Austen, Woolf), to reveal the obscured roots of what gave birth to the novel in the first place.",47,"WOS:000418498200001",3

Tortured subjects acquire membership of a collective memory of pain, a trauma-memory citizenship, made possible through the articulation of memories of torture, bringing together fellow sufferers, former perpetrators and witnesses.

"English",,,"This essay examines anxieties about literary adaptation that affect the representation of same-sex friendship in William Shakespeare's and John Fletcher's The Two Noble Kinsmen, a dramatization of Geoffrey Chaucer's the Knight's Tale that transforms its source material from a cautiously optimistic romance to a bitterly pessimistic tragicomedy. By changing the sworn brothers at the center of Chaucer's tale into perfect friends in the tradition of Aristotle and Cicero, Shakespeare and Fletcher invoke a popular understanding of same-sex friendship as immune to the vagaries of erotic love. Then, the playwrights demolish this ideal in a way that presents friendship as an occasion for tragedy. The fragility of friendship can be seen most clearly in the play's garden scene, which uses the symbolic connotations of two particular flowersthe narcissus and the roseto suggest that friendship is vulnerable to both self-love and erotic desire. The stock symbolic meanings of flowers are transformed for the unusual purpose of branding same-sex friendship as a doomed relationship. The shift toward tragedy in this literary adaptation reflects Shakespeare and Fletcher's discomfort at following in the footsteps of Father Chaucer. [R.S]",62,"WOS:000412193800004",3
"English",,"FENCES; DREAM; MYTH; HOME","This essay examines Barry Beckham's Runner Mack (1972)-the first black-authored baseball novel-and argues that it set a significant, though undervalued, precedent in entering the white-dominated field of baseball literature, deftly representing the experience of the dream deferred for black athletes in the post-Jackie Robinson era. Nominated for a National Book Award in 1973, Runner Mack has now fallen out of cultural currency and has yet to gain the critical consideration it merits. As this essay demonstrates, Beckham originated a tradition of black baseball fiction extended by Percival Everett's novel Suder (1983) that critiques dominant American myths without replacing them with an alternative mythos and/or pantheon of heroes. Whereas August Wilson's play Fences (1985) and other tales of black baseball praise the unsung heroes of the Negro Leagues, Beckham makes use of satire and surrealism to expose what Roland Barthes terms the ""metalanguage"" of myth. Putting Runner Mack in dialogue with Suder and Fences, this essay also illuminates these authors' divergent views when it comes to the role that myth should (Wilson) or should not (Beckham and Everett) play in challenging Anglocentrism and empowering African Americans-views that are suggestive of broader ideological debates that arose in the years after de jure segregation ended but racial inequities continued. This small but nonetheless significant black baseball subgenre, therefore, provides a productive glimpse into these debates as they were filtered through America's most metaphorically rich sport.",49,"WOS:000400866800005",3

Instead of dismissing this literattire as a form of complaint, as many scholars do, I take writers' concerns seriously, but I also look at the difficulty even professional writers faced in mounting any kind of case for themselves as paid creative personnel. Even when writers made a rational argument to explain why they should be paid more, they tended to undermine themselves, invariably intimating that writers as a group were better off impoverished. These difficulties, I argue, arose not just from the systems of industrial publishing but also from the systems of political value instituted by art in what Jacques Ranciere calls the ""aesthetic regime.""

Saturated by neo-liberal maxims of individual agency and self-optimization, the protagonists perceive their madness to be an issue and flaw they have to manage on their own. Through the employment of a neo-liberal madness, Roche disconnects women's psychological issues from the wider context in which they are embedded, failing to criticize the larger societal structures that continue to prevent German women from achieving true equality.

This approach locates similar impulses for ""reading"" and shaping-via film-in stories that involved film or the film industry, in film-related advertising, in editorial matter and readers' letters, in reviews, and in cover illustrations, all suggesting an interest in, even fascination with ""scientifilms,"" as they were often termed.

"English","Banville; Adorno; redemption; postmodernism; ekphrasis",,"This essay examines how Theodor Adorno's criteria for aesthetic redemption provide the organizing principle within John Banville's Athena. By examining aesthetic theories by Sventlana Alpers, Ernst Gombrich, and Adorno himself as they appear within the narrator's descriptions of northern European seventeenth-century paintings, the author illustrates how Banville's novel not only reflects debates about whether seventeenth-century art proves descriptive or narrative but also compels the Adornian reflective process that attends to the nonidentity between one's own categories and the material before one. That process turns readers' attention back to Banville's confessional narrative, which develops through vivid depictions of the narrator's meandering quest to atone for a murder committed in this trilogy's first novel. By undermining conventions for the confessional format, Banville's novel engages readers in reflection on the dissonance within the novel and provides a portrait of the conditions of contemporary subjectivity that carries guilt for historical suffering yet still aspires toward redemption.",22,"WOS:000414182300006",3

In these novels each heroine's close relationship with her ghostly protagonist-one a poor Mexican American liquor smuggler in the 1920s, the other a poor cholo gangbanger from the near present-reveals specificities and differences between regional experiences, especially those of working-class and poor Mexican Americans. Through the lens of gothic theory and critical regionalism, I consider the ways that specific Mexican American cultures are evoked through the plot elements of a popular genre like the gothic romance. I argue that the striking prevalence of scenes of Mexican American regional and ethnic poverty in what would seem to be ""beach read"" popular novels suggests that in the Mexican American gothic, the sense of anxiety and abjection requires uneasy scenes of Mexican American destitution and violence, scenes which function as the true heart of gothic fear and uncertainty for their heroines.",21,"WOS:000409160000003",3

As responses to current environmental conditions, urban farming literature such as Farm City and The Vertical Farm, as Anthropocene narratives, occupy powerful positions in configurations of the history and future of the Earth. While Anthropocene narratives often adopt an apocalyptic tone, are intimately tied to issues of climate change, and warn of the planet's bleak prospects, Farm City and The Vertical Farm present a brighter vision wherein human agency is redeemed as the driving force behind environmental reform and celebrate stewardship and technological innovation. Calling attention to cities and farming, urban farming intervenes into apocalyptic Anthropocene visions by suggesting an agrarianism that celebrates small family farming and an ethic of interconnectedness, on the one hand, and vertical farming and techno-scientific stewardship, on the other, as alternatives to a history of loss and recovery. The currency of urban farming brings to the fore an Anthropocene future wherein cities and farming are redeemed from their villainous status and conceptualized as human-created geological forces embodying an ideal of human-nonhuman interdependence.",32,"WOS:000400593600004",3

The fact that they are ineffectual as detectives is made more powerful by setting: Rendell places these criminal acts in the home, which in earlier female detective fiction is presented as a source of power for women, but which in Rendell's early fiction is a site of unrest. Using insights from feminist geographers of space, who examine the interplay of gender and physical environment, illuminates how the characters' situations undermine the supposed safety of the domestic sphere. In questioning the country home and the suburban household as seats of domesticity and familial harmony, Rendell highlights the lingering difficulties women have of conceiving of themselves outside of male-created paradigms of femininity. She draws upon not just early women's detective fiction but gothic and sensation fiction, too, each of which emphasizes the home and women's roles in either the protection of or subversion of that traditional female sphere. In these early stand-alone novels, Rendell destabilizes the ways in which both the home and the women in it are constructed. Though these novels have received scant critical attention, they show that from the outset, Rendell's concern has not necessarily been for the detective story as much as it has been for the psychological nuances of her female characters.",30,"WOS:000398033400004",3

Reading architectural history against gender history, the essay reveals how the balcony serves as a locus for emerging intersections of gender, desire and the tensions between privacy and public display in the Renaissance city.

"English",,,"This essay examines the diverse political-economic registers of Andy Weir's The Martian (2011) in terms of its symbolic response to the material and ideological crises of the Great Recession. The 2008 financial collapse in the US led to millions losing their homes and posed a serious challenge to the legitimacy of mainstream economic principles. Published at the height of the crisis, and concerning itself with the monumental challenge of bringing just one person home, the novel writes contested economic discourses into cultural fable. On Mars, Mark Watney's potato farming evokes the paradigmatic neoclassical economic figure of homo economicus, the self interested, maximizing agent who constantly prioritizes competing choices in order to allocate scarce resources rationally. NASA's Earth, conversely, is a fantastic world of ""unlimited funding"" where, overturning two centuries of (neo)classical economic principle, ""every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out"" (Weir 36869). The novel's confused attempts to reconcile homo economicus with a workable concept of the common good can be historicized.

Conflicting impulses to claim the Old Negro as an ancestor and to renounce him as an obstacle to racial progress mirrored a broader tension about representing slavery in black cultural production. While Alain Locke and other critics called for literature to portray the Negro of the new day and discard the old representations, James Weldon Johnson understood the Old Negro's enduring importance to modern black self conception. His 1912 novel, The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man, portrays the consequences of accepting-existing, white-authored literary representations of the Old Negro. While Johnson's ex colored man fails to reclaim this figure, Johnson himself did exactly that in his 1917 adaptation of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), an operatic cantata that until now has never been examined. In this text, Johnson incorporates and evolves the Old Negro into a contemporary literary tradition that challenges the racial violence of Jim Crow and celebrates black survival.",45,"WOS:000396638400002",3
"English","science fiction; Nnedi Okorafor; structural adjustment programs; institutionalism; African universities; brain drain",,"This essay examines the recent rise in popularity of science fiction in Africa. I argue that this growth can be traced to key shifts within the logic of structural adjustment programs. Over the last twenty years, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have begun to place a heightened emphasis on ""poverty reduction strategies"" (or PRSs). These PRSs have taken the two organizations' longstanding commitment to free-market policies and adapted them to the rhetoric of social and economic justice by suggesting that sustainable welfare programs can only be constructed through the long-term benefits of well-planned ""institutions."" As I show, this vision of long-term development has encouraged a move toward fictional forms capable of speaking to elongated temporal scales. Using Nnedi Okorafor's novel Lagoon as my primary example, I investigate how sci-fi narratives have struggled to represent social agency within the longue duree of institutional planning.",53,"WOS:000405186400007",3
"English","Typography; publishing; Modernism; the body; prosody",,"This essay examines the relationship between composition, typography, publishing, and sexuality in the poetry of E.E. Cummings. Cummings composed his poems with microscopic attention to their visual form, often reworking their layout numerous times, and this article will analyse a seminal shift in the genesis of his mise-en-page. Typography is one branch of literary form which cannot be abstracted from the materials and accidents of book production. Situated within the mechanical processes of publication and characterisations of the typewriter from Heidegger and Olson, Cummings's typographical poetics are shown to be contingent upon, but resistant to, the machinery of composition and publishing. Censorship of sexual explicitness and suppression of overly graphic typography are tightly interwoven in the textual history of Cummings's 1923 Tulips and Chimneys. Through close-readings of the mise-en-page of the volume, this article will argue that the sexual ethics of these poems must be considered through their typography, and depend on how we view and scrutinise the page layout as well as the bodies described therein. For typography to be considered a form of prosody, however, it cannot be reduced to a singular function or simply an uncomplicated analogue for the body.",40,"WOS:000416544100016",3
"English",,,"This essay examines the relationship between genre and franchise though a discussion of the Dragonlance series, a collection of pre-fabricated adventures for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons adapted into a series of novels. Because of the sheer number of these novels (approximately 200), the fiction set in the AD&D campaign setting known as Krynn far surpasses the scope of the original adventures in terms of narrative, character, geographical location, and historical situation. The sprawling nature of the novels, which implicitly seek to be an exhaustive account of Krynn and everything that happens there, would make Dragonlance one of the longest series in the history of generic fantasy. However, as I demonstrate, the development of the Dragonlance narrative takes place in the context of a franchise that turns away from the conventions of genre fantasy. The double origin of Dragonlance as both a setting for adventures in the AD&D game system and as a series of fantasy novels creates both the mechanistic feel of the early novels (those that were adapted directly from the pre-fabricated adventures and even from actual gaming sessions) as well as opportunities for the novels to eventually break from the conventions of generic fantasy, especially the latter's particular concern with endings. My consideration of Dragonlance not only offers a consideration of the merely generic texts with which this special issue concerns itself, but also a means by which critics might consider franchises as objects.",37,"WOS:000418348000002",3

Then, it turns to the rival narrative forms Bernstein and Sheehan use-what I term the Dickensian and modernist modes, respectively-to represent the legal, social, and emotional turmoil surrounding the foster care system.

Read from a Christian perspective, Purgatory may be a work far from purgation, as T. S. Eliot once complained. I wish to show in this essay that Purgatory indeed places emphasis on purgation by a negative example, if in a different way from the Catholic one. Yeats denies the linear eschatology of Christian theology as well as its doctrine of salvation in eternal heaven. In A Vision, Yeats explains his view of the afterlife of the soul, which involves purgation through 'the Dreaming Back'. The special treatment of the Old Man renders Purgatory a meta-purgatorial play that mirrors the Dreaming Back of his mother's spirit in the Old Man's, intensifying the theme of purgation. Purgatory effectively dramatizes the inability to forgive and cast out remorse: the impossibility of nishikam karma, or selfless action, to borrow Sanskrit terms, which is essential for Yeatsian salvation.

"English",,,"This essay explores how Rachel Hartman's fantasy duology Seraphina (2012) and Shadow Scale (2015) functions as posthumanist young adult hagiography. As a hybrid - and especially as a hybrid between human and cold, rational dragon - Hartman's protagonist Seraphina begs comparison to Donna Haraway's cyborg, existing at the nexus of embodiment and discourse. Like Haraway's cyborg, the figure of the half-dragon as constructed by Seraphina's culture is associated with ""blasphemy,"" yet Hartman's duology shows that a cyborg need not be areligious and can even be a Saint, as the half-dragons are ultimately revealed to be. Like the grotesque bodies of saints in Christian hagiography, the bodies of Hartman's half-dragon Saints challenge the boundaries of the modem self, gesturing toward posthumanist intersubjectivity through the ways in which their minds and bodies are linked. However, the series also emphasizes that each half-dragon occupies a different set of intersectional subject positions.

The essay pursues this idea to suggest that seventeenth-century natural philosophy routinely expected to come upon exploratory thresholds, beyond which reason and logic failed to function adequately. The response to this endemic inscrutability of the world in scientific writing was to borrow from the apophatic, the theological traditions by which the unspeakable and the unthinkable, the outermost borderlands of experience, were reckoned.

"English","Religion; Dissent; community; Gaskell",,"This essay explores the collaborative life writing of communities across time: specifically, the disparate, questioning, quarrelsome religious groupings of Rational Dissent as Unitarianism gradually emerged as a separate sect at the turn of the nineteenth century. It focusses on three moments of life writing in different genres by Rational Dissenters: sermons by Theophilus Lindsey, a memoir by his wife Hannah Lindsey, and the novel North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell. Moving across genre and century, it analyses the ways in which a Unitarian identity evolved through the nineteenth century, and asks how individuals constructed their own religious identity while also participating in a larger Dissenting tradition. Lacking a unifying creed, and with its adherents often professing different and sometimes contradictory theological beliefs, Unitarianism is not easy to define or describe. Yet this is precisely why group historiography and collective biographies become important: Rational Dissenters come to rely on shared allusions and narratives to bind them together, such as the memory of Black Bartholomew's Day, the Great Ejection of 1662. The essay traces such allusions through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to explore the enduring collective concerns of a communityand to show how, in the hands of Gaskell, these might make their way into a larger literary dialogue.",20,"WOS:000399578600005",3

While critics have praised Telgemeier's text for its racially and ethnically diverse cast of characters, the moonlight-and-magnolias musical that forms the centerpiece to Drama traffics not simply in a historical myth, but in a white-centric fantasy.

The meaning of the theater, and the meanings attributed to the cultural icons of Shakespeare and Milton, played important parts in the cultural battle between royalists and republicans, and those debates continue to shape literary studies in the twenty-first-century university despite recent reevaluations of the literature of the Civil War and the Revolution. Shakespeare is walled off from Milton, drama separated from poetry, prose, and epic. These divides distort the readings of the period's literature and, at a time of resource scarcity, threaten to limit which writers and texts are researched and taught.

In the latter case, which applies both to Dante's siren ( in Purgatorio XIX) and to Petrarch's Laura (particularly in RVF 16), the presence of the Veronica can only properly be understood in contradistinction to the poetic idolatry which haunts each text. In particular, Laura is found to be an idol for three reasons: Petrarch's worship of her name; doubts over her existence; and the Pygmalion myth that haunts Martini's portrait of Petrarch's beloved. For Petrarch, the only possible solution to the temptation of idolatry is a Dantean one, namely invocation of a further icon, the Virgin Mary (both in RVF 366 and in his Testament), even if the Canzoniere is never fully able to forsake Laura.",60,"WOS:000407548300001",3

While it has been argued that Mabanckou's text falls in line with the litterature-monde paradigm and thus debunks the notion of Francophonie, I contend that it depicts the entire enterprise of origins as always already doomed to failure and proposes in its place a relational thought-model that surpasses the dialectical thought that grounds universalism and particularism alike. Thematically, Mabanckou portrays character quests for originality as absurd; on the level of narrative mode, he uses murky narrative positions and temporality to unhinge the authority of the singular speaking subject; finally, through the incorporation of intertextual references, he defies the very logic driving the notion of origins. Composing his text out of others' gone before, Mabanckou pushes diversity to a higher conceptual level; he appropriates and repurposes old fragments, joining them up in one relational space so that they might gain new meaning.",19,"WOS:000409195400003",3

Inflected by Melville's late encounter with Arthur Schopenhauer's ruminations on ""will power,"" Melville uses neuroscience to develop Schopenhauer's idea into what I am calling a ""corporeal reading"" practice. This is a reading practice, I argue, that erodes the ontological distinction between the mind and body, between the mind as subject and the body as mere object. Yet because Melville set this novel in wartime, this new reading practice also reveals the deep, and often deadly, tensions that accompany understanding the body as having a mind of its own.

It discusses the differences of opinion about porches and thresholds between puritans and Laudians. The final section sets out a case study in the wedding poems of Robert Herrick. Herrick's epithalamia dramatize moments of threshold-crossing in order to imagine how marriage rites transform their subjects' identities.

"English","Intertextuality; Victorian literary biography; Romantic sociability; De Quincey; Trelawny; quotation",,"This essay explores the ways in which literary biographers have made intertextual allusions to the work of their subjects as a means of reconstituting lost personal and creative relationships. Thomas De Quincey's Lake Reminiscences' (1839) and Edward Trelawny's Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron (1858; revised 1878), were auto/biographical accounts of time spent amongst Romantic literary friendship circles. Building on recent approaches to Romantic sociability within these groups, I argue that the quotations from the poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley and Byron in the Reminiscences' and Recollections show De Quincey and Trelawny extending and reconfiguring the collaborative, allusive practices of the Lake poets and the Pisan circle. However, unlike the poets they memorialised, De Quincey and Trelawny were importing poetic quotations into prose auto/biographies aimed at a mass early- to mid-Victorian readership, in an age of literary celebrity. In distinctive ways, their languages of allusion created relationships between biographer, subjects and audience, whose desire for participation in the literary circle was modelled by the biographers themselves.

"English","art; equilibrium; materiality; philosophy; Schelling",,"This essay explores what happens when Schelling takes the concept of equilibrium and introduces it into the Philosophie der Kunst, and it takes as its point of departure the observation that equilibrium appears with both remarkable frequency and adaptability in this area of Schelling's thought. My essay then shows how in his philosophy of art, there is a kind of proliferation that leads to what might be described as a density of different modes of equilibrium. It demonstrates how the differences between the different modes of equilibrium in the Philosophie der Kunst can be explained in terms of their quantitative or qualitative aspects. This is noteworthy because it implies that the primal distinction of equilibrium as metaphor Schelling makes in the Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Naturas that which mediates between material and non-material regimesreturns in the Philosophie der Kunst and becomes an object of inquiry in its own right.",7,"WOS:000399662200004",3

Moreover, the essay proposes a reading of the extensive network of references to Black history, knowledge systems, and intertexts evoked throughout the collection as offering a way to transcend the Black diasporic subject's isolation and to connect to a shared and ongoing history of oppression, displacement, and marginalization on the one hand but of agency, resistance, and self-empowerment on the other.",53,"WOS:000414522600008",3

It begins and ends with Adorno's critique of actionism in order to see what is lost when the clarity and certainty of political action is privileged over scholarly nuance and complexity (praxis over theory). This loss is surveyed through a set of related binaries (supersessionism, foundationalism, and disciplinarity), which, it is contended, reduces critical thinking to polemic and makes it all but impossible to explore interconnected Jewish and postcolonial histories. The argument is illustrated with reference to postcolonial literature and by examining the disciplining of postcolonial and memory studies in relation to the Holocaust. A way out of the binary impasse, it is suggested, is to utilize as traveling concepts transcultural and transnational histories (such as diaspora and ghetto) that Jewish and postcolonial studies have in common.",71,"WOS:000409043800006",3
"English","the workplace novel; Bildungsroman; the rise of China; the middle class; Asian values",,"This essay focuses on the relation between cultural formation and economic development in post-socialist China, reading the (re)emergence of a literary form as a site of cultural negotiation regarding China's new relation to the world in the twenty-first century. As China's integration into the world economy has an increasing impact on international institutions and global affairs, China's recent ""rise"" has recalibrated the contours of globalization. Within the context of changing ideas of the ""global,"" this paper concerns itself with questions of universality and particularity, wondering how ""universal"" values are normalized and naturalized in a global context, and how the Chinese example measures up to, modifies, and contends with the world system that produces those normalizations. As part of an argument that literature does more than reflect certain historical activities, namely that it also carries within itself a vision of a micro-history, this essay reads contemporary China in the small. Specifically, the paper looks at the Chinese ""workplace"" novel, a new form whose genre the Bildungsroman-is imbricated with the formation of the modern subject and modernity. My reading of the workplace novel focuses on its formal appropriation and transformation, attending to its relation to the ""given universality"" of international human rights law. The circulation of the Bildungsroman via the workplace novel in China at the turn of the twenty-first century challenges the historical narrative function of the Bildungsroman as it has been theorized on the basis of generally European examples.",54,"WOS:000400593600014",3
"English",,,"This essay focuses on the work of two Yoruba-language poet-performers, Lanrewaju Adepoju and Olatubosun Oladapo, as an example of artistic treatment of secularism. Both are accomplished poets with several poetry volumes, scores of audio LPs and cassettes, and studio broadcasts to their credit. They work in the genre of ewi, Yoruba poetry composed in print and recited over an orchestra of percussive music, with or without sung sequences. Though they compose and perform exclusively in Yoruba, the social impulse of their work is to an inclusive Nigerian public that is imagined to be differentiated and representative of the world at large. It is from this conception that I shall explore the idea of secularism, a worldly practice of political critique emerging out of the simultaneity of socioeconomic-artistic spheres that is flexible, incorporative, and open to change.

"English","American literature; Danish literature; postmodernism; enchantment; literary theory; biopower",,"This essay highlights a distinction within contemporary fiction, and uses it to argue for a parallel distinction within a trend of contemporary criticism. It begins by describing similarities between the so-called New Sincerity, most famously associated with American writers such as Jonathan Safran Foer and Dave Eggers (though I suggest that it has resonances in Europe as well), and the various turns against critique, from scholars including Rita Felski, Sharon Marcus, and Stephen Best, among others. My discussion of the correspondence between these movements centers on the dynamic of recognition, the relationship to a depicted character or event that draws the reader into experiences of understanding and solidarity, and which also provides the basis for self-reflection. An emphasis on recognition links the literary and critical movements; recognition is essential to what the New Sincerity asks of the reader, and the term has also become a central one for critics of critique, who seek to habilitate it as a subject of scholarly interest. Yet the critical movement has, or should have, a significantly different relationship with recognition than the New Sincerity does. In its most useful iteration, this essay argues, the turn against critique in Anglophone criticism looks (or will look, or should look) less like its cousin in the American novel than like some contemporary fiction from outside the United States - in this case, from Denmark. This essay offers readings of three short stories by Naja Marie Aidt, storiesthat share enough with the New Sincerity to make their departures from it especially salient. Rather than simply endorsing recognition - positioning recognitive empathy as desirable - Aidt's stories offer more measured observations of how recognition works as an already present part of everyday social and political interaction. As well as showing some of the international diversity of recent fiction's interest in intimacy and immediate connection, this distinction may be crucial in establishing the turn against critique as an actionable mode of literary analysis.",36,"WOS:000414182300005",3

Bechdel created Fun Home from 1999 through 2005 dates that corresponded with Bush's campaign, election, and presidency. As Bechdel frequently laments in her serialized comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For, the Bush presidency posited truth as unknowable, facts as infinitely flexible, and faith as constitutive of reality. Fun Home never mentions the president (nor any historical figure or event after the mid-1980s), but the memoir uses newly available digital technology to resist Bush-era ""truthiness."" In Fun Home, Bechdel combines digital photography, her body in performance, and hand drawing to create a new form of graphic narrative.

Apparent both in the poem's depiction of indolence as a wavering between mind states, and in its wordplay, ambiguity and structural instability, this shifty quality presents an unsettling, more mischievous side of Negative Capability. This quality may account, too, for the peculiar textual instability of the ode, which has seen the order of its stanzas variously rearranged by critics and editors over the course of its bibliographical history. The essay concludes by considering the indolence of the poem's title in relation to a pun contained in its epigraph, which raises questions about what drives poetic creativity and considers the distinction between the labour of professional authorship versus ideas about inspiration and organic composition.",25,"WOS:000398018100003",3

Science is presented in these two novels as the discourse of objectivity, enjoying largely unproblematic access to the workings of the material universe, and the reality that science describes is seen to underlie the models of realism utilized in each text. Realism, and the scientifically backed reality that supports it, is placed in opposition to a particular type of mindset, embodied by religious extremists, the broadly postmodern humanities, and climate change deniers, all of whom are seen to represent, and be in thrall to, an excessive focus on the subjective world.",19,"WOS:000406563200007",3

Although contemporary ecocriticism argues that we must move from apocalyptic depictions of risk to realistic ones, this essay examines fictions of nuclear waste commissioned by the Department of Energy to show that a risk-based realism is used to maintain the status quo of settler colonialism. It then turns to a countermodeling of the futures of nuclear waste by Leslie Marmon Silko in Almanac of the Dead (1991), where uranium's longue duree future, impossible to imagine from a human perspective, recasts the present as a space in which the unlikely, implausible, and unrealistic saturate the everyday.

I argue that Ventrakl, which stages a long encounter and collaboration' with the early twentieth-century Austrian poet Georg Trakl, enriches our understanding of the relationship between translation and contemporary experimental poetic practice through a method that I term radical contextualization'. By strenuously foregrounding the processes of learning and composition that go into its vanguardist attempt at an encounter with history, Ventrakl also foregrounds the question of the ethics of learning, particularly as it affects the relationship between artistic originality and historical reliance on pre-codified modes of communication and authority. I read Ventrakl in light of both translation theory (especially the possibilities opened up by Benjamin's famous formulations in Die Aufgabe des ubersetzers') and theories of vanguardism and political efficacy in order to point out how important a poetics of translation, particularly one combined with the demystifying properties of contextualisation, can be for a more generalised theory of avant-garde poetic practice.",49,"WOS:000395155000008",3

At the same time, based on the protagonist's radical re-evaluation of Berniniafter two centuries of critical dismissalthis article also sheds light on the deep and substantial relationship connecting the Roman Baroque and D'Annunzio's aesthetics. The rediscovered culture of the 17(th) century indeed constitutes not only a key element in Il piacere, but also an important poetic prelude for D'Annunzio's hoped-for renaissance of the arts, and for the scholarly re-appreciation of the genius of Bernini (from Riegl to Wittkower).

"English","El Debate; Guillermo Gomez Windham; Jose Rizal; Maria Paz Zamora Mascunana; Pedro Paterno; Sofia Reyes de Veyra",,"This essay investigates the intersections of American empire and American feminism via literature by Filipinas in Spanish. Texts written in Manila by hispanophone Filipinas who were also American subjects and American nationals present a defamiliarizing phenomenon that casts anew standard historical-literary accounts of the 20th century United States. The literary output of Maria Paz Zamora, for instance, reveals an America that emerges on shores not commonly taken to be American at all and yet are more indicative, arguably, of the modern United States than any other. Paz Zamora was the first Asian woman to produce a short story collection in Spanish (Mi obolo, 1924), the co-author of a bilingual cookbook (Everyday Cookery for the Home, 1930 and 1934), and the only Filipina known to have published a World War II memoir in Spanish. Like all Filipinos during the American colonization of the archipelago, however, Paz Zamora was also an American subject designated by the United States as an American national. This essay analyzes her oeuvre within the contexts of early Filipina literature in general and within the gender politics of the Spanish-language press in Manila of her day, but argues ultimately that a principal reason for studying her is to seek a globalized revision of what has been, ever since 1898, a globalized America.",55,"WOS:000409131200002",3

The editorial treatment of paratexts in The New Oxford Shakespeare, especially their scholarly curation and placement in its old-spelling Critical Reference Edition rather than its Modern Critical Edition, raises questions about where Shakespeare begins and ends, and how we situate him in relation to other agents of textual production. I propose the need to challenge the perceived opposition between ""Shakespearean text"" and ""non-Shakespearean paratext"", and to consider the possibilities - raised by work in early modern paratext studies - of editing Shakespeare's paratexts as ""parerga"", ""metatexts"", or even just ""texts"".

The surprising presence of Pater in texts shaped by brutal military conflict not only demonstrates the power of models of cultural transmission he developed at a point when his reputation was at a far lower ebb in the English-speaking world than it was on a war-ravaged continent, but also opens up the possibility of recognizing elements that are still galvanizing and disturbing in his work.",51,"WOS:000401279100003",3

This essay contests these readings quite directly, and sees this work as in fact highly political. It presents a revisionist reading of v. in the polemical contexts of its composition and reception. It is also in v. that Harrison most directly voices his enduring identification with the nineteenth-century French poet Arthur Rimbaud (1854-91). Rimbaud's importance for Harrison's poetic and identity has gone unnoticed in the scholarship, but is examined in this essay. Detailed attention is also accorded to the aesthetic and political importance for v. of its literary model of difference, Thomas Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, which has not hitherto been fully understood. v. ends with the poet's epitaph.

The Hermaphrodite tells the story of Laurence, a deeply contemplative, intelligent person whose sexual identity is disputed, but Howe never employs the term ""hermaphrodite"" outright. This situation encourages readers to judge Laurence's hermaphroditism by his behavior and actions in the novel, not his biology, and this is furthermore consistent with the way the term ""hermaphrodite"" was used and understood by mid-nineteenth-century Americans. As such, this essay examines the claims that Howe makes about the social machinery of gender in The Hermaphrodite, arguing that while Laurence has much in common with Balzac's Sarrasine, Howe uses her protagonist as a means of revising outdated arguments about biological ""truth.""

The question of whether Nairobi Heat and Black Star Nairobi attempt to illuminate the genocide or only evoke it as background shapes the approach to the popular. The essay then identifies ways in which Mukoma's novels are also in conversation with the more canonical works of anticolonial writing back to empire and in fact perform an unnarration, or blotting out, of that discourse and the historical dynamics that inform it. Mukoma does not divorce himself entirely from this older literary project, which exercises a disruptive influence in the popular as he configures it.

Caught up in the scramble for the Arctic, Alaska is directly affected by climate change, but the state's vastness also forms a metaphor for the tremendous challenges our ecological crisis puts before us: the sublime landscape forms an Anthropocenic archive of human activity, and its scalar vastness and unmappability challenge human imagination. This essay questions the rhetorical utopianism and idealism about the planetary consciousness apparently generated by new technology, showing that art and literature argue for a sober, pragmatic approach to our crisis in scaling up our imagination. After tracing traditional Alaskan mythologies, I show how contemporary eco-memoirs test and challenge humanist dogmas. The Big Data project, I Love Alaska, and the cinematographic exploration of AI and human evolution, Ex Machina, also point beyond humanism and posit Alaska as a potent imaginary space where anti-anthropocentric ideas, the changing relationship between humans and nature, and the potential of a planetary consciousness/memory can be explored.

"English",,,"This essay looks at the vital role played by translation in the global circulation of texts. It traces the uneasiness about both interlingual and intralingual translation that has prevailed in English literary studies and in Anglophone postcolonial studies, arguing that critiques of a Eurocentric canon have merely resulted in the inclusion of more writers who use only varieties of English. The essay goes on to suggest that as translations are increasingly seen as creative rewritings rather than as copies of a superior original, the notion of translation can be broadened to encompass a wide variety of textual interpretations and the significance of translation as an enabling force in world literature is beginning to be recognised.",26,"WOS:000398110400002",3

Demonstrating how the novel articulates more complexly and illuminates more creatively the cultural and subjective anxiety associated with the negotiation of identitarian roots and routes, the essay puts forward an existential, materialist re-reading of Afropolitanism which considers the lived intersectional interactions of race, ethnicity, gender, class and age in the formation of contemporary Afrodiasporic subjectivities.",73,"WOS:000407610100004",3
"English","Female Gothic; metafiction; tactical feminism; matricide; female madness; (female) sublime",,"This essay makes a case for Fiona Kidman's inclusion in the international feminist canon and focuses on her contribution to feminist metafiction in her redeployment of the Gothic genre in her second novel, Mandarin Summer (1981). In her reinvention of the genre, Kidman departs from the compromises of ""victim feminism"" that Diane Hoeveler has identified as characterizing the Female Gothic in favour of a tactical feminism that brings about the triumph of female cognitive power. This essay uses the successive contexts invoked by Kidman's particular brand of feminism, the Female Gothic tradition, and Mandarin Summer's textual ancestry in Jane Eyre to consider how a female epistemic site emerges through the novel's tactical containment and encircling of patriarchal plots. This is partly enabled by the Janus-eyed vision of its central protagonist, who rejects patriarchy's binary divisions between women, and partly through the protagonist's refusal to be complicit in the symbolic and actual murder of mothers. However, in Kidman's denouement, the rescuing of women comes at a price.",32,"WOS:000393150300004",3
"English","apathy; indifference; feeling; emotion; affect; Herman Melville",,"This essay makes a pair of interrelated claims about apathy. One of these is literary historical, the other critical-literary. During the turbulent middle decades of the nineteenth century, a number of US writers resorted to the emotionless state of apathy even as the wider culture normalized the possession and display of feelings. The antebellum writings of author Herman Melville are hardly alone in demonstrating apathy's hermeneutic and aesthetic uses; they nevertheless suggest a concentrated encounter with apathy, given how the author thematically foregrounds unfeeling in his work. In Melville's writings, we discover an alternative affective register for the characteristic emotionalism of US literary culture in the decades surrounding the nation's Civil War. Meanwhile, apathy continues to pose a challenge to the emotionally implicated modes of reading, reception, and response that have enjoyed critical favor in recent years as a broadly conceived affect studies. If apathy is not a foil for the study of affect, it does extend the emotional range of our criticism by modeling a way to formulate feelings those associated with the literary subjects of our scholarship, as well as those that inform and motivate our work in the first place in relative and relational terms. Apathy is more than a generational disposition of postmoderns or the cool, emotionless province of ""critique"" that Rita Felski identifies with what she (after the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur) names a ""hermeneutics of suspicion."" Rather, apathy is an interpretive stance in its own right, proactive in the critical postures it adopts as much as it is reactive to any culture that defines itself, at least in part, on the basis of its relation to feelings.",45,"WOS:000407871800004",3
"English","Richard Duke of York (3 Henry VI); Richard III; infanticide",,"This essay offers a fresh reading of Shakespeare's preoccupation with the sacrifice of children to dynastic futurity in the first tetralogy, the three parts of Henry VI and Richard III. It shows how these plays blend psychological, metaphysical and political perspectives and veer from a world of disenchanted politics into the claustrophobic blood-feuding of classical tragedy. It argues that children in this world exist as figures in someone else's play; as royal pawns in adult power games they are the fragile vessels of dynastic ambition. The fate of children offers a spectacle of English history as a tragedy of failed succession, a viewpoint which not only politically troubles triumphant Elizabethan providentialism, but also reminds us of the existential role that children play in negotiating the fear of human mortality. It rereads Richard III against the earlier tetralogy to show how the ontological vulnerability of Richard is connected to the killing off of heirs. These dead children reveal the tragic precariousness of mortal existence precisely because they are the mystified objects of future promise.",17,"WOS:000405718900001",3
"English","Corinthians; Erasmus; Bible; reference; metatheatre",,"This essay offers a re-interpretation of the Dream's central religious allusion, the echo of 1 Corinthians 2.9-10 in Bottom's 'vision' speech. It is argued that the speech's signification must be understood as contextualized by the utilization made of holy reference throughout the Dream. To this end the text highlights a number of religious allusions (some previously unremarked), and demonstrates the nature of these appropriations as offering dislocation to the references' sacred indication. Bottom's speech itself is approached via Stuart Siliar's suggestion that the lines indicate a possible allusion to Chaloner's translation of Erasmus's Morix Encomium. I show how a more expanded understanding of the relationship between these two texts would work to elaborate the Dream's thematic concern with the elevation of the ignorant and the inversion of authority. More significantly, I suggest that these allusions work to transpose the appropriated vision of mystical revelation into that of a vision realized through the aesthetic processes of a theatre of dissimulation.",18,"WOS:000404077600003",3

It identifies a recurring attention to, and irruption of, the quotidian within early modern epic style, plot, and narratology, and formal innovation at many of epic's most characteristic moments.

The general idea is not to think generic incommensurability as necessarily disabling, but rather that the ill-fitting tropes of genre identification are productively engaged in a politics of non-conformance, here elaborated as a logic of counter-fitting. Counter-fitting, what does not fit generic expectation, is not counterfeiting as false but is a politics of aesthetics in which generic authenticity is put into question by the very unevenness of cultural contact and expression. Like the counterfeit, however, the counter-fit reveals something of the logic of exchange in the circulation of genres while also calling into question the attachment to a pure representation. Drawing on this interpretation of the counterfeit, counter-fitting is less a paradigm of difference, to borrow from V. Y. Mudimbe, but rather focuses attention on how such a material production of otherness is problematized at the level of genre. Some examples drawn from Algerian fiction will help to clarify this approach.",53,"WOS:000405186400002",3

Although the crisis never explicitly registers in the narrative, various moments of imperial affirmation and anxiety suggest that it may have the status of a symptom. I read with and against this supposition. In the essay's first section, I show how the repression of imperial crisis in Stevens's narrative is entangled with his memories of fascist appeasement and complicity. Prompted by the text's pervasive and self-conscious interest in Freudian figures of memoryits untimeliness and displacementsthe second part argues that The Remains of the Day incorporates the symptom as an aesthetic and historical strategy in order to itself theorize a postcolonial symptomatology. The novel thus helps us complicate the proposition that symptomatic reading is something critics do to texts and suggests, in its allegory of symptomatic reading, the contours of a postcolonial interpretive method.",62,"WOS:000395489800006",3
"English",,,"This essay pays attention to the fiction of Eric Linklater, a prolific and successful writer whose work has not received the attention it deserves. Today he is chiefly remembered as the author of Juan in America (1931), Magnus Merriman (1934) and Private Angelo (1946), three novels often classified as entertainments and, therefore, treated by critics with some condescension. This essay does not attempt to establish a hierarchy of merit but considers most of Linklater's fiction as a whole. Taking the author's eclecticism for granted, it underlines that this should be seen both as a rejection of common norms of Scottish fiction and a desire to go beyond the limitations of the Scottish scene in order to consider the totality of world experience. Inevitably, this raises the issue of Scotland's place and its relationships with the rest of the world. This is not perceived as problematic but instead as a source of fruitful enrichment. The nature of Linklater's fiction is consequently affected by this opening towards foreign cultures in so far as the shift has an impact upon settings, forms of narration, literary models and even language. At a time when there is constant debate about the meaning of 'Scottishness' and plurality of identity, Eric Linklater's example can still be useful.",35,"WOS:000416179500007",3

Authors who were penning, and tournament participants who were acting out, the romances Philip Sidney among them were defending a social terrain that gunpowder was rendering obsolete.

"English","Conceptual writing; Vanessa Place; feminism; allegory",,"This essay positions Vanessa Place's Tragodia (2011) as an instance of reframing as contemporary feminist cultural critique. An enquiry into allegory, hermeneutics, and the performative use of indifference in Place's conceptual writing generates insights into new narrative conditions produced by Place's work. Tragodia does not represent trauma but rather generates trauma through a poetic practice that has a bipartite structure: conceptual writing (allegory) and Place's performances of the narratives. Place's performance is read in this analysis as an ancillary act of reframing that raises the question of what might be at stake in the performative use of indifference. Understood as a strategy of failure, Place's performance parallels the lack of mediation in the conceptual act of reframing. Positioned counter to the linguistic deformation of the subjects' speech acts and the erasure of affect that occurs in the legal narratives through the act of interpretation, the refusal to interpret implicit in the act of reframing in Tragodia is an ethical gesture, a paratextual pathway to metamorphosis. In its refusal to interpret, Tragodia creates a site of contextual resistance to the oppression of the subjects' organic narratives by the institutional language of the law, and offers a new textual field of meaning-making.",11,"WOS:000401448100009",3
"English","Blake; rhyme; contraries; repetition; Jerusalem; Milton",,"This essay posits rhyme as an important locus of invigorating 'Contraries' in Blake's spiritual ideology and poetic practice. It explores tensions in Blake's conception of rhyme as unthinking abandon and over-reasoning rigidity, a trivialising indulgence yet rife with Urizenic implications. Moving through the Poetical Sketches and Songs to the climactic epic Jerusalem, we see how Blake seeks greater formal freedom in more capacious - or 'crooked' - poetic lines, aiming to embody the unrehearsed voice of a 'true Orator' and avoid passive 'Sing Song' reading. But Blake also frequently exploits the fixity of formal rhyme schemes to dramatically enact the oppressiveness of 'enclos'd' mindsets, so that the 'bounding lines' of his form often pivot between expressing and imposing ideas of order that bespeak both technical precision and limitation. The essay goes on to consider Blake's use of repetition in particular as one means of reconciling the paradoxes flung up by the presence and absence of rhyme throughout his canon.",14,"WOS:000404884500003",3
"English",,"OF-NORTHUMBERLAND","This essay presents an unpublished meditation on friendship by Henry Percy (1564-1632), ninth Earl of Northumberland. In contrast to early modern writers who celebrated an idealized vision of perfect friendship inherited from Aristotle and Cicero, Northumberland's vividly autobiographical essay recounts his youthful disappointments in finding true friends and his eventual realization that the perfect friendship extolled by poets and philosophers is in fact a chimera that precludes human happiness. A semi-diplomatic transcription of the essay is preceded by an account of Northumberland's life and other writings in addition to a consideration of the essay's philosophical sources, its composition date and genre, and its treatment of the literary. Indeed, not only does Northumberland's essay both accept and critique the Horatian-Sidneian theory of poetry's edifying power, his specific examples of indoctrinating (a ballad about Damon and Pythias and a pedagogical performance of the Nisus and Euryalus story) may well have come from his own life.

At first glance, Rorty and Conrad, who hardly share the same political worldview, appear to have little in common other than their mutual predilection for irony. Yet on closer inspection Lord Jim contains a profound critique of Rorty's liberal ethnocentrism, which is rooted paradoxically not in differences but affinities between the moral attitudes of the two writers.

"English","law and literature; narrative analysis; ""inevitable discovery""; detective fiction; Fourth Amendment; U.S. Constitution; huntsman's paradigm",,"This essay raises questions about ways in which law and the interpretive humanities might intersect in such manner as to offer real insight one to another. Specifically, it addresses the use of narrative in the law, and its analytic study. Stories, I argue, are not events in the world, but the way we tell events, a crucial distinction sometimes unrecognized in legal opinions. Examples analyzed include the doctrine of ""inevitable discovery"" articulated by the Supreme Court in Nix v. Williams, juxtaposed to the creation of a seeming inevitability in the stories of Sherlock Holmes. These issues are further clarified through a discussion of historian Carlo Ginzburg's reflections on the ""huntsman's paradigm"" and the workings of ""retrospective prophecy."" The essay then turns more closely to the analysis of narrative, particularly the end-determined nature of narrative meaning, and to the one Supreme Court case I am aware of that discusses narrative in an analytic way: Justice Souter's opinion in Old Chief v. U.S. Further examples are drawn from rape adjudication (Rusk v. Maryland) and post conviction petitions for relief (Mickens v. Taylor). If narrative, telling the facts, plays so important a role in law, shouldn't the law arm itself with more tools in the analysis of narrative?

"English","Villette; first person narrative; psychology; phrenology; strategy; tactics","'VILLETTE'; BRONTE,CHARLOTTE; NARRATION","This essay reads Charlotte Bronte's use of first-person narration in Villette as a contribution to a Victorian reassessment of personal identity as material, heterogeneous, and adaptive. Challenging common readings of Bronte's first-person fictions as displays of self-definition and authority, I unpack the relationship between the narrated and narrating person in both Jane Eyre and Villette to reveal dual operations of narrative world-making strategies and adaptive tactics that express competing notions of personhood. By comparing Villette (1853) to Jane Eyre (1847), we can chart a shift from a strategic to a tactical emphasis in narration indicative, I argue, of a broader movement in nineteenth-century thought from Cartesian dualism toward associationist and materialist theories of consciousness as adaptive and processual. Villette's narrative tactics demonstrate the potential in novel form to enact processes of being in the world that challenge both traditional concepts of a unified, self-contained consciousness and new Victorian scientific conceptions of a material mind only knowable from science's ""objective"" perspective. Positioning Bronte's novel form alongside psychological debates about the nature and study of mind, I show how the novel offers alternative methodologies and conclusions about the nature of personhood to those proffered by an emerging Victorian psychology. When Bronte's first-person narrative produces (rather than assumes the prior presence of) a ""person"" narrating, it asks us to read that production of identity and consciousness as an experiment with what it means to experience oneself as, in the words of Jane Eyre, a ""heterogeneous thing.""",57,"WOS:000400224000004",3

"English",,,"This essay reads the South Korean sf thriller 2009: Lost Memories as an allegory about the history of Korean national sovereignty. Set in an alternate timeline in which this national history has been erased as a result of a Japanese conspiracy, the film's time-travel plot focuses on a group of Korean resistance fighters who struggle to restore the ""lost memory"" of an authentic Korean national past. This alternate timeline-a timeline in which the national past is portrayed, paradoxically, as the product of an alternate present-achieves two related ideological functions. First, by erasing the problems posed to Korean national identity by the collaboration of a Korean elite during the colonial era, the film's allohistorical narrative perpetuates the myth of an effective anti colonial movement. Second, the alternate timeline provides a fictional mechanism to circumvent what Michel Foucault has described as the historical limit imposed by the atom bomb (and threat of mutually assured destruction) upon the institution of sovereignty and its ability to wage all-out war. Unable to assert its sovereignty in a war with Japan, Korea carries out its anti-colonial myth in the form of an allohistorical narrative. This nationalist appropriation of the genre of alternate history, however, fails to suppress what Marx describes in the Eighteenth Brumaire as the reduction of tragic action to farce, resulting from the repetition of historic events. In Lost Memories, the same time-travel narrative that allows the film to live out its anti-colonial fantasy has the unintended effect of reducing its nationalistic melodrama to an inauthentic historical parody.",20,"WOS:000414380500007",3

Taking up Roberto Schwarz's challenge to advance a reading practice that takes into account the difference between literature and social structure in the colonial periphery, I argue that rather than viewing His Native Soil's improbabilities of plot and tonal dissonances as artistic flaws, they are more meaningfully read as the author's attempt to adapt the realist protocols of the bildungsroman to capture the double-edged nature of independence: the adoption of a trade policy that would economically bind together the Philippines and the United States and that would render political freedom impossible for Filipinos unless relations of colonial dependency were to be continued after independence.",99,"WOS:000407871800006",3

Attention to Transfusion. reveals a Gothic novel expressly concerned with articulating a biological idea of the family, dramatizing the fatal consequences of ""porous"" family arrangements that transgress the absolute boundaries erected by blood. Godwin Jr. mobilizes early-nineteenth-century proto-evolutionary discourses and biomedical theories in order to reject the viability of socially constructed or affective familial structures, reflecting cultural anxieties about how to define the family and, ultimately, the species. However, the novel's deterministic account of family relations appears also directly to oppose the contractual family ideal that characterized both how Godwin Sr. imagined the family and, to a lesser extent, how the Godwin-Shelley family constituted itself.

Torn between the moral and financial demands of his rural, traditionalist kin and those of the colony's urban elite, Obi succumbs to corruption, voicing his downfall and Nigeria's botched independence through a sardonic self-acquittal.

"English","As You Like It; Richard II",,"This essay situates Hamlet in the history of theatrical representations of melancholy. Traditionally, early modern stage melancholics were dramatically distanced from other characters on stage either by the isolating effects of their condition, or by the dramatic irony that made their lack of self-awareness ridiculous, as with the melancholy Jaques. Hamlet, uniquely, assigns dramatic control over this curious dramatic space to the melancholic himself. In exaggerating his melancholy, Hamlet manipulates stage conventions associated with melancholy to exploit this dramatic space as a protective form of privacy from authority, even in that authority's surveilling midst. This exaggerated version of ""the scholar's disease"" links Hamlet with the rebellious Earl of Essex, whom Francis Bacon counselled to ""pretend to be as bookish and contemplative as ever you were"" in order to disarm Elizabeth's growing distrust. Hamlet's metatheatrical representation of melancholy, and its relevance to Essex's rebellion, partakes in the collapse of melancholy's medical conception and the diffusion of its signification into literary, social and political realms. It also dramatizes how this concept's collapse and diffusion could be exploited by disaffected scholars as a means of concealing resistance to authority as apolitical disposition or disease.",20,"WOS:000396575400002",3

"English","Shakespeare; market capitalism; usury; reification; gift; public and private sphere",,"This essay situates Shakespeare's two most economic' plays, The Merchant of Venice and Timon of Athens, in the context of contemporary debates on usury and other relevant aspects of the market economy that ushered in the transition from a feudal economy to a capitalist one in sixteenth-century England. The debates resulted in the statute of 1571 that legalised money-lending, provided that it did not exceed a maximum interest rate, fixed by the State, of 10%. This settlement was the result of a cultural as well as ideological compromise between Christian and market values that legitimised a capitalist economy while at the same time defusing its disruptive aspects. The author argues that Shakespeare's two plays offer a dramatic reflection on the advent of a market-based economy in England and the cultural negotiations underpinning it; a reflection that also involves a critical examination of the social relations, in both the public and private spheres, that emerged alongside the new market economy. The Merchant of Venice discloses the real political and class-determined nature of the compromise underlying the 1571 statute, whereas the later Timon of Athens shows the historical inadequacy of this settlement in the light of the increasing dominance of the market, which was progressively imposing its own ideology and dictating its own politics.",25,"WOS:000396175700002",3

It chronicles the linguistic as well as conceptual connections between conventions, play, and Plot, and it considers the ways in which Middleton's play rewrites Hamlet for the world after the Powder Treason. Turning to recent scholarship that emphasizes how other early Jacobean plays 'negotiated' with the intended treason, it concludes by arguing that The Revenger's Tragedy's approach to the Gunpowder Plot is fundamentally parodic, using Plot discourse for metatheatrical effects in ways that both undermine the standard pro-Jacobean and providential tone of most Plot discourse and refuse to endorse clearly either plotter or plotted against.",60,"WOS:000397153500004",3
"English",,"WALLACE,DAVID,FOSTER 'INFINITE-JEST'","This essay submits David Foster Wallace's major work Infinite Jest, famous for its vehement critique of postmodern culture, to a thoroughly dialectical method of analysis. In contrast to many previous studies of Wallace's novel, a dialectical approach conceives of postmodernism not as a 'style' of writing available among others to an individual author like Wallace but as a socio-cultural dominant to which the text is indissolubly and actively connected. The essay attempts such a 'totalizing' reading of Infinite Jest and an assessment of the text's difference from postmodernism by moving through two distinct horizons of historicizing interpretation. First, the analysis aims to demonstrate that on the level of content the text is governed by a semantic opposition between freedom and value that can be read in terms of the novel's structuring ideological system. Second, on the level of form, Infinite Jest is analyzed in terms of a formal conflict between postmodern spatiality and a latent utopian impulse mediated by the novel's incorporation of science fiction elements.",11,"WOS:000399284200005",3

"English","Thomas Hardy; The Woodlanders; Arthur Schopenhauer; evolution; ecocriticism",,"This essay takes issue with two truisms within Thomas Hardy criticism: first, the widely accepted view that The Woodlanders (1887) is Hardy's most ""Darwinian"" work; and second, the standard assumption that Arthur Schopenhauer's influence on Hardy's writing can be discerned specifically in the works from Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891) onward, and primarily in the unrelenting pessimism that characterizes both writers' worldviews. The essay calls into question the simplification underlying both positions by suggesting ways in which Schopenhauer's metaphysics may have influenced Hardy's treatment of evolutionary themes in The Woodlanders, paying particular attention to Hardy's choice of plant life as the dominant metaphor within the novel, and the numerous ways in which the evolutionary model it depicts diverges from that formulated by thinkers such as Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. It argues furthermore that Schopenhauer's philosophy of nature therefore offers the optimum framework through which to interpret Hardy's unique ecological vision in the novel, and calls for renewed attention to the philosopher's proto-phenomenological description of reality, the significance of which has been largely overlooked by recent ecocritical scholars searching for a non-Cartesian framework in which to couch their readings.",41,"WOS:000399066000004",3
"English","Walter Scott; The Bride of Lammermoor; momentaneousness; cliffhanger; Henry Fuseli",,"This essay takes up the debate at the beginning of Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (1819), noting that critics have generally treated one figure in this debate-Dick Tinto, the painter who advises our narrator to use less dialogue and more descriptive language-as a strawman. Critics have mostly overlooked the extent to which Tinto articulates the dynamics of ""momentaneousness,'' an aesthetic principle drawn from Scott's contemporary, Henry Fuseli. Fuseli defined a momentaneous painting as one that represents a moment with a clear past and future. For Fuseli, paintings ought to select pregnant moments for representation, moments from which whole narrative sequences can be intuited. Implicit in this notion is the belief that some moments are particularly suited to representation because they are qualitatively different from others-more fully narrative, because more indicative of larger processes of change. Turning to Scott's novel, I show how this assumption features prominently in The Bride of Lammermoor, where it repeatedly produces unforeseen, calamitous consequences. The moment's disruptive potential culminates in an aptly novelistic take on momentaneousness: the cliffhanger. The cliffhanger draws the act of reading into a circuit of temporal interruption and delay, reproducing the bad timing endemic to the novel's plot. When read as an instance of momentaneous representation, The Bride's climactic cliffhanger can be said to incorporate the reader's own interpretive activity into the bewildering experience of historical time that the novel depicts. This technique, I argue, helps to account for The Bride's peculiar place in the Waverley canon-its pessimistic historical vision and fatalistic narrative logic.",28,"WOS:000425259700001",3

Drawing on a framework of critical regionalism, I argue that Nguyen's novels link her characters' deeply personal navigation of community and identity as Asian Americans in the Midwest, national myths romanticizing a white pioneer past, and political narratives over who belongs and who should be excluded in the post-9/11 era.",28,"WOS:000409160000006",3

After showing that Egmont's appeal is based on the affective immediacy that distinguishes memory from history, the essay argues that he is as much a ` new politician' as Alba and Oranien, well aware of the political power of the imagination, fully conscious of what the Spanish occupation means in Brussels, and as capable as his antagonists of a calculated response.

Within this comparative framework, Shakespeare builds from Italian social experience in Cinzio's novella and Niccola Machiavelli's political discourse to critique the shift from local to state legal authority occurring throughout sixteenth-century England. Specifically, Shakespeare's Measure for Measure challenges commanding perceptions of communal justice fundamental to English legal ideology and reveals law's theatrical power.

The novel's representations of city space, intimacy, and erotic transgression are mirrored in its narrative architectures, which invite readers into transgressive reading postures. Complicating the reader's relationship with the text, the talking book of Jazz simulates modern architectural space in its challenge to the interior and exterior dimensions of textual space.

I argue that hustling is a social process that involves an array of socializations, and is experienced subjectively as anticipatory work towards careers in the film/TV industries. Students come to realize that their hustling towards curricular and pedagogical requirements is a synecdoche for the larger industrial careers they aspire to, careers that demand even more hustling and precariousness, but careers that they are better prepared for than they know.

An implication of this proposed shift in interpretation is that Plato and the Sophists are both reasonably seen as ""post-truth"" thinkers, concerned more with the mix of chance and skill in the construction of truth than with the truth as such. Focusing on Plato's hostility to playwrights, I argue that at stake is control over ""modal power,"" which is ultimately about defining the sphere of what is possible in society.

He published the novels johannie giet die beeld (1954, Johannesburg casts the graven image; The Golden Magnet, 1984) and Met erbarming, O Here (1957, With Compassion, Oh Lord). In this chapter Sulzer provides valuable information on several of Fula's unpublished works of which none has survived. This includes the unpublished novel 'n Zoeloe-dogter (A Zulu Daughter), two novellas ""Vader Kalashe"" (Pastor Kalashe) and ""Matsiliso van Phomolong"" (Matsiliso of Phomolong), and several poems. Fula's prose writing often explored the tensions between tradition and modernity. Sulzer's view argued in this chapter is that the author's poetry is ""of greater literary value than the novellas"". Sulzer's unpublished chapter provides valuable background and literary commentary on a writer who has largely been forgotten.",6,"WOS:000406439000015",3

On one hand, this is achieved by exploring the historicity and geography of race, insofar as the text dwells on how the totalitarian German state and the Second World War concur to impose shifting and sometimes even antagonistic forms of racialization on all non-Aryans. On the other, it is the result of bringing together characters that, while phenotypically belonging to the same group, are yet altogether dissimilar as to origins, language and upbringing.

"English","Translator's Ethos; Translation; Implied Translator; Translated Narrative Discourse","SOCIOLOGY; BOURDIEU","This paper aims at exploring the configuration of the discursive image or ethos attached to the enunciative subject assuming the responsibility for the enunciation of translated narrative (Ducrot 1984; Amossy 1999, 2009, 2012). Our concern will be the study of the modeling of ethos affecting the Translator, understood here not as an empirical subject but as a discursive one. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is two-fold. On a theoretical and methodological level, this paper intends to elaborate the category of Translator's ethos by articulating contributions from two distinct but related areas, translation studies (Schiavi 1996; Hermans 2010 [1996]) and discourse studies (Ducrot 1984; Amossy 1999, 2009, 2012), in an attempt to further explore an already posed question in the field of translation studies: ""Exactly whose voice comes to us when we read translated discourse?"" (Hermans 2010 119961: 197). On the analytical level, this interdisciplinary approach will be exemplified by the analysis of Chicana novel Caramelo or Puro Cuento by Sandra Cisneros (2002a) and its corresponding translation into Spanish carried out by Liliana Valenzuela (Cisneros 2002b). In examining the construction of ethos, our approach will combine textual, contextual and paratextual analyses of the texts.",85,"WOS:000407840200009",3
"English","Cortazar; Antonioni; Borges; web of texts; hermeneutics; metafiction; photography",,"This paper analyses a borderline case of adaptation and its potential implications for adaptation studies at large: Antonioni's cinematographic reading and rendering of a short story by Julio Cortazar, Las babas del diablo (1959), as presented in his 1966 film, Blow-Up. We argue that adaptation in this case operates on a 'deep' level, that of the ramified web of connected texts, a level where fundamental questions are raised about mimesis, particularly concerning the fragile condition and ephemeral existence into which a story inevitably projects its imaginary characters. Close reading further allows for establishing that Antonioni hermeneutically meets Cortazar's short story in the well-orchestrated impression of substantiality dissolving into its opposite. An interpretive link is also presented with the tradition of Latin-American fiction developed in the wake of Borges' metafictional writings, specifically concerning bidirectional influence, as illustrated in 'Pierre Menard, autor del Quijote'. Along the way, critical attention is given to current notions in adaptation theory and hermeneutics, including the interaction between both fields.",13,"WOS:000424104500005",3
"English","Environmental rights; Short story analysis; Kalman Mikszath; Stories about trees",,"This paper analyses a short story written in 1900 by Kalman Mikszath (1847-1910), a major Hungarian author. The plot narrates the genesis and the consequences of a strange last will, which bequeaths a substantial amount of money to two trees. The plot is partly funny, partly uncanny, and evolves rather slowly, in accordance with the long and rather inactive life cycles of trees. It is not so much the plot, however, that is interesting, but rather the ethical discourse of the personae in how to deal with the trees. Due to the exceptional legal situation, various people start regarding the trees as persons and have difficulties in making decisions about them. While it would be an overstatement to say that Mikszath wrote a prototext of environmental justice, he definitely challenged some ideas of his times and asked important questions about possible ethical approaches to nature. Legal issues are ubiquitous in world literature, but the world of law is usually limited to human affairs. As soon as trees are treated as legal subjects, they seem to become persons. Usually the development is the reverse in legal reasoning: if one is a person, one has rights. Therefore the short story is a sort of thought-experiment: what if we regard the non-human world as having rights? And the result is a paradigm shift we can nowadays make use of, accepting that justice is not or should not be limited to just the human sphere.",20,"WOS:000414980500009",3

The author concludes by locating Pung's works, particularly Her Father's Daughter, among various other memoirs of the Pol Pot period, including poet U Sam Oeur's memoir, Crossing Three Wildernesses (2005).

The judge has been called on to preside over a murder trial in 1937, a decade after Fascism had re-instated the death penalty, considered by the Regime a deterrent that would allow Italians to sleep with open doors. To that end, I consider the historical context in which the novel was writtengiven that Italian Constitution, in force since 1 January 1948, had abolished the death penaltyand the impact Sciascia sought to have on his readers. That is, Sciascia's long-time opposition to the death penalty is to some extent pretext for re-litigating' in 1987, a decade after the fact, two polemics of the late 1970s. The first public controversy had been sparked by his declaration (issued during the trial of colonna torinese of the Red Brigades) of personal neutrality in the struggle of the Italian State to suppress terrorist subversion, the other by Sciascia's contention that the political parties who refused to negotiate with the terrorists for the release of Aldo Moro had indirectly re-introduced the death penalty in Italy.",57,"WOS:000413165300013",3

In particular, the genre of documentary filmmaking provides one crucial site for exploring how cultural representations of the city of Beijing and environmental pollutions often recenter human-centric narratives of planetary rescue through what I term ""Anthropocentric futurism."" Anthropocentric futurism as a critical terminology names a double bind while increasing numbers of cultural productions like literature, cinema, and the popular media explore human subjects as both the agents and passive ""victims"" under the Anthropocene, often such an ecological awareness automatically gives rise to a passionate human-centric discourse of planetary rescue. Specifically, I examine the widely popular 2015 documentary about air pollution, Under the Dome, directed by Chai Jing, as one that reproduces Anthropocentric futurism through the logic of maternal rescue, whereas Jiuliang Wang's Beijing Besieged by Waste (2011) radically departs from such reproductive futurism by visualizing the violent coevalness between the human subjects, non-human animals, inanimate objects, and the environment as such. Thinking beyond Anthropocentric futurism suggests new possibilities for theorizing the relationship between China and the Anthropocene through the lens of affect theory, animal studies, and posthumanism.",46,"WOS:000400593600007",3

Here, I examine the novels as clear extensions of Lerner's poetic project as seen in his three volumes of verse', and link them to the theoretical discussions of poetics one finds in the prose of poets like Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Dickinson, or Pound. This in turn opens the way to seeing Lerner as engaged in an ongoing project in which neither prose nor poetry is privileged, but each dialogues with the other in what must be considered a serial prosimetrum. Following from this, I examine how the prose writings illuminate and enact the poetics of virtuality which Lerner favours and explores in many ways, not least of which being the displacement of poetry and poetics into novels, and the disturbing of the claims generally made for each genre. Ultimately, Lerner's opposition to mere actuality' or mere positivity' can only be understood if his novels are allowed to be disturbed by the volumes of poetry that surround them, rather than being left to stand as copious containers that might bound the poetic impulse.",22,"WOS:000395155000007",3
"English","exhibition; China; new media; museum; posthuman; memory; zombie; trauma",,"This paper argues that in her recent films, the Chinese artist-filmmaker Cao Fei (b. 1978) shows how the futility of art and technologies of exhibition is linked to the danger of overexposure to images without context, and the numbing of public consciousness. In the twenty-first century, the fear of forgetting seems increasingly obsolete in the face of social media tools like Facebook's ""See Your Memories: Never Miss a Memory"" feature, which excavates photos uploaded, shared, or tagged on the site years ago, reminding users to ""look back"" on otherwise lost memories. However, in recent Chinese fiction (Ma Jian's Beijing Coma; Chan Koonchung's The Fat Years; Liu Cixin's ""The Weight of Memories""), the trope of dormant memories remains noticeably prevalent, reflecting an urgent cultural concern about the conscious ""act of deleting memories"" (Yan Lianke) in the process of recording modern Chinese history. Whether in the form of documentary-style animation (i.Mirror, 2007), zombie-horror film (Haze and Fog, 2013), or stop-motion train-replica dioramas (La Town, 2014), Cao Fei fantasizes about a new posthuman consciousness, whose most serious trespass against humanity is not forgetting, but rather not feeling. Presenting disjointed scenes that call upon instances of trauma and surveillance, Cao's ""posthuman trilogy"" films suggest that when cosmopolitan memories become decontextualized, mere images no longer possess any meaningful symbolic power. Further, Cao's films demonstrate that voyeurism becomes an unavoidable yet inconsequential daily practice in the digital age of exhibition.",58,"WOS:000417475000010",3
"English","Charlotte Bronte; documents; Gothic; Jane Eyre; nineteenth century; Ranciere",,"This paper argues that Jane Eyre's struggle to develop epistemological authority in her own life is shaped by three key documents - a letter from her uncle, Richard Mason's testimony, and her own signature - which are presented to her at climactic moments in her journey. The documents, in turn, present sites upon which Jane can confront the lasting influence of the past over her life and identity. In this regard, the documents are 'Gothicized', and interpreting their roles in the novel presents an opportunity for exploring how characters in the present, especially Jane, can create productive knowledge that gives them power over their own lives. Furthermore, by drawing on Jacques Ranciere's theories about the image, this paper argues that readers experience the aforementioned documents in unique ways that enable them to make connections between Charlotte Bronte's novel and other forms of discourse, most notably legal discourse.",6,"WOS:000389820500002",3
"English","Karen Tei Yamashita; globalization; Anthropocene; ecocriticism; literature and the city; American literature",,"This paper argues that Karen Tei Yamashita's novel Tropic of Orange (1997) provides a prescient, Anthropocene vision of the city. The idea of the Anthropocene a geological epoch dominated by human-driven changes to the environment blurs tidy distinctions between the human and the natural. But literary and ecocritical depictions of the city have frequently relied on such categories, imagining the city as a distinctly unnatural space. Tropic of Orange offers an alternative urban vision, depicting Los Angeles as a complex ecological space, shaped both by material histories and by unjust social systems. The novel uses magical realist elements to reverse what Jean and John L. Comaroff have described as the ""occult economies"" of globalization, making the material elements of global exchange visible as they move through the city. Similarly, magical events draw together crowds of people, living and dead, who have been integrated into the city's economy, making the human element of the city's impact visible as well. By materializing the human and ecological networks that support the city, and by rejecting traditionally escapist and pastoral visions of the natural world, Tropic of Orange offers a complex vision of the city as a sociomaterial ecosystem. While the novel does not offer a fully-formed alternative urban vision, it does provide a cautionary tale about what will happen if we do not accept the fundamental challenges that the Anthropocene provides to conventional understandings of nature, ecology, and human responsibility.",36,"WOS:000400593600002",3

By reading 'Fears in Solitude' and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner through recent work in social psychology and the philosophy of ethics, I show how Coleridge creates causalities of feeling, affirming meaningful relationships of responsibility that go beyond personal guilt.

"English","Tony Harrison; negative dialectics; masculinity; iambic pentameter; politics","1980S","This paper argues that, despite being classified as an unambiguous political statement against the Thatcherite government, Tony Harrison's v. is a complex exercise in negative dialectics that resists revealing a clear polemical stance. A close reading of the poem, focusing on its structure, its indebtedness to Thomas Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and finally its representation of the female body throughout the narrative, reveals that the politics of v. are unable to articulate themselves in an unambiguous way. The 'v' that constitutes a catalogue of 'versuses' for the poet-narrator delineates the struggles of the poem: the conflicted poet-narrator against the disaffected skinhead; the poet's desire to foreground his personal subjectivity against his desire to subsume it; the poet's insecurities about his masculinity against his desire to create a 'working marriage' uniting masculine and feminine. These conflicts play out through the poem without resolution, revealing that neither of the two main characters in the poem, nor the poem itself, present an integrated course of action or even a fully articulated reaction to the socioeconomic moment that Harrison chooses as its setting. Rather than a feasible political stance, Harrison's v. performs the sort of negative dialectics advocated by Theodor Adorno.",20,"WOS:000416544100010",3
"English","Literature; Spatial turn; GIS; Digital humanities; Telescopic reading",,"This paper begins with the so-called spatial turn and goes on to examine one of its most recent offshoots: the cartographic turn. After analysing the implications that this turn, particularly its digital aspect, may have on a possible mappability of literature and on the definition of an emerging field like spatial humanities, the paper will discuss the broad disciplinary spectrum of digital humanities and its possible convergences with this cartographic and spatialising trend through the changes experienced by the contemporary textual condition (from the large-scale digitation of texts to the spread of multimedia). The paper also explores the split between an eminently quantitative approach and a qualitative one, within both digital and spatial humanities, when tackling the study of texts, whether they be literary or otherwise. This duality leads to the current debate between defenders and detractors of what Franco Moretti dubbed distant reading, a critical practice that opposes the traditional method of close reading. As the paper attempts to argue, that distant perspective is closely linked to the cartographic turn and does not necessarily involve using exclusively quantitative tools and giving up close reading as a means of accessing texts. In this sense, through the underlying concept of some literary GIS and of the emerging notion of deep or thick mapping, the paper argues for the possibility of a telescopic reading which, as part of the approaches and interests of spatial and digital humanities, combines quantitative and qualitative methods and makes a distant focus (that is, cartographic) compatible with a close reading of texts.",40,"WOS:000400571400007",3

These narratives are further enriched by folkloric and supernatural twists that orient global audiences as well as younger generations of Filipinos abroad on Filipino cultural heritage. On the other hand, the representations embedded in these narratives contain traces of self-orientalism, reinforcing essentializing binary divisions where Filipinos or ""Orientals"" are stuck with the negative attributes and the ""happy endings"" also push the minority group further into the margins vis-a-vis the privileged British center.

"English",,,"This paper considers the final literary publication in British exile of the London-based Free German League of Culture, Kleine Sammlung 1946: Gedichte, Erzahlungen, Reproduktionen. Appearing at the point when many political exiles were awaiting permits to return to Germany, this collection of short literary works by eleven writers sets out its aims as twofold: it was conceived as the FGLC's first anthology for readers in Germany as well as their last words in British exile. The paper concludes that, on the one hand, exile appears to have made little impact on the work of these particular writers while, on the other, the little volume's impact on post-war Germany was probably minimal. Nevertheless, it is posited that the very fact that during the Third Reich the exiled writers had represented free German culture outside Germany, as stressed in the preface of the Kleine Sammlung, would have been significant for a post-war German readership. Finally, in light of the writers' declared wish in 1946 to return to Germany, the paper considers their various final destinations.

Far from debasing the cultural authority of the originals by blurring the boundaries between high and popular culture, these versions can be seen as an act of salvage of the original texts from the perceived difficulties of challenging language and content, reinvigorating them with a vibrant immediacy. By making demands on the imagination and intellect in exciting ways, they may also salvage the act of reading itself by encouraging a young or reluctant readership, as well as the already enthusiastic, to explore new ways of engaging with a text.",9,"WOS:000432024900003",3

It uses observations of nine lessons of English writing in combination with semi-structured interviews of 39 first year upper secondary students in Norway. The findings show that students in general appreciate the feedback, but have diverging views about the different types and forms of feedback provided. The majority want to have one-to-one discussions with the teacher about their texts in addition to written feedback, and to receive more specific comments on both content and language. Most are content to use feedback in a delayed fashion, as a reference point for future writings. This is a result from the working routine in the classrooms where feedback in most cases comes with a grade without a strict requirement to follow-up comprehensively, with the exception of correcting language errors. The findings highlight the primacy of form in the feedback provided and, in more than one way, poor quality formative feedback from the students' perspective. It concludes that in order to maximize the formative potential of feedback there is a need to make it more usable, e.g. by giving it to ungraded texts and asking students to produce improved work based on feedback.",62,"WOS:000407840200007",3

The term 'salvage' will be used in several metaphorical senses here. By tracing back 'salvage' to its wider etymological origins in the Latin word 'saluus', which refers to both physical and spiritual salvation, I will employ this term to describe the saving of the bodies and souls of ballet protagonists. I will argue that the evolution of ballet costumes and technique was linked to the appearance of a number of unconventional salvage scenes in which traditional gender roles were reversed and women saved men. Several examples will be used to demonstrate how ballet librettists changed the literary sources when they transposed them into libretti in order to add these scenes. The term 'salvage' can also refer to 'the saving and collection of waste material [...] for recycling'.(1) Now, in this sense ballet libretti 'recycled' literary source texts, and so enact salvage through adaptation. What is more, elements from previous libretti were recycled in nineteenth-century ballets, through the re-enactment of certain archetypal situations, including rescue scenes and acts of spiritual salvation.",36,"WOS:000432024900004",3

As salient actors within the 'internally legitimate' sphere of the sport, this paper explores the way the MMA media construct symbolic boundaries around different kinds of fights through aesthetic and moral evaluations. Through qualitative content analysis of MMA media discourse, I attempt to reconstruct their general aesthetic principles, demonstrating a fourfold typology of MMA in practice: repulsive 'excessive violence', boring 'insufficient action', soft 'palatable practices', and sublime 'aesthetic violence'. This framework allows the MMA media as 'connoisseurs' to create hierarchical 'distinctions' between their aesthetic attitudes and those of more casual 'mass' audiences.

These posters are both descriptive (indicating for instance the names of the actors and the number of days on which the show can be viewed) and evaluative (stressing novelty, uniqueness, or indeed both features simultaneously). Accompanied by important paralinguistic and extralinguistic tools, such as the use of images, choice of typeface, and poster layout, such strategies are selected to make the posters striking and consequently memorable.

Firmly within the conventions of science fiction (high technology, exploration and colonization of other worlds, alien 'species, etc.), the collection stands out for its intense reflection on emotional bonds between humans and nonhumans and for placing female characters at the center of this web of relationships. This paper shows how women's roles in these stories not only renew the generic codes of sf, giving prominence to mother and goddess figures, but also deconstruct the literary representations of the feminine by challenging the idea of woman as life-giver and rejecting the idea of women in love as passive and defenseless.",19,"WOS:000404322900006",3

An appraisal of Herbstein's representations within the framework of postcolonial theory reveals how Herbstein deviates from the stereotypical norm of narrating the rape of female captives and slaves during the era of the trans-Atlantic slave trade by creating graphic rape images in his narration. This study therefore shows that a postcolonial reading of Herbstein's novel addresses the representations of rape and male sexual aggression in literary discourse and contributes to the arguments on sexual violence against women from the past to the present.",53,"WOS:000410450000007",3

It argues that while the novel reflects her awareness of the agency of colonized Indians and the precarious predicament of the colonizer in the subcontinent, its deployment of Gothic literary modes had the effect of accentuating racism and disorientation in the contact zone. This essay argues that while the memsahib's private journals allowed space for moments when racial and class distinctions were temporarily eroded, the novel's prescriptive genre constraints did not allow for such occurrences.

In the novel, the desert refuge for scientists is controlled by a massive computer. The protagonist becomes aware that the AT has become sentient and is planning to use nuclear weapons to destroy humanity. The analysis will compare The Blue Flood to Robert A. Heinlein's 1966 classic The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, wherein the AT leads the human colonists of Luna in a successful struggle for independence from Earth. In The Blue Flood a sentient being with superhuman powers can only be conceived as a form of blasphemy. From this, we can take the text as a warning to intellectuals in real-world Morocco not to dismiss Islamic and cultural traditions simply because they seem irrational. The insights gleaned from The Blue Flood open up The Moon is a Harsh Mistress to a reading that contrasts with prevailing scholarly judgment i.e., Heinlein's novel can now be read as less a failed advocacy of libertarianism than an extended critique of the unlikelihood and vulnerabilities of a libertarian society.",24,"WOS:000394556100003",3
"English","Battle of Alcazar; Peele; purgatory; structural approach; four elements; revenge tragedy; Kyd",,"This paper examines the co-authored revenge tragedy Titus Andronicus (pub. 1594) as a subtly constructed space (as we read it on the page) that emphasizes its hellish torments and moral message through an oblique use of a graduated elemental scheme within it. The four elements are loosely clustered according to the act divisions of the play established in the First Folio. The play incorporates the elements according to a Virgilian-Aristotelian scheme, progressing naturally from earth to fire, and so demonstrates an intertwined dual framework of renaissance natural philosophy and religion reminiscent of classical and medieval purgatorial and hellish concepts. The elements thereby form a running and varying structural conceit that reinforces the hellish experience that an audience (or reader) might expect from a revenge tragedy, including George Peele's Battle of Alcazar. When understood in this way, we see how the elemental scheme undergirding the play provides a structural moral and intellectual coherence relevant to all of us. The individual characters undergo horrendous torments and remarkable changes; they are, in a sense, writhing souls in communal suffering bound by the cosmic borders of the stage, which was commonly understood conceptually as a microcosm. The underlying elemental scheme reinforces the concept of the play as a virtual or parodic hell and/or purgatory: a play that begins amid earthly desires and burials ends with the destructive bonfires of the living hell that the characters thrust (and bake) themselves into.",65,"WOS:000405718900004",3

Using an African feminist approach, the paper juxtaposes the historical and contemporary institution of polygyny in relation to gender role negotiation and how contemporary writers build on their literary precursors in re-writing the history of polygyny and gender according to the socio-cultural needs of twenty-first century Africans. These changes in socio-cultural, economic and political spheres in Africa have played a pivotal role in altering family structure and arrangements.

The story, which originally featured a heavy use of idioms from Shanghainese, was initially serialized on longdang.org in 2011. It went through multiple revisions and took its current shape as a book-length novel one year after being published in Harvest in 2012. During the revisions, the author significantly altered the component of fangyan expressions in order to speak to a broader Sinophone readership. In the first section, I discuss the incorporation of features of Internet literature in the book by tracing the cross-media adaptation of the story with regard to the choice of languages and the use of aural elements. In the second section, I focus on Jin's integration of interactive storytelling strategies borrowed from the Wu fangyan literature and culture, and how the use of the online medium made it possible to disrupt the linear construction of history. Finally, I situate Jin's story within the network of Sinophone cultures to see how he re-enacts contemporary representations of Shanghai through cinematic aesthetics evident in Sinophone cinema from Hong Kong and Taiwan. In all three aspects, rendering sounds and voices in written forms plays a crucial role in the narrative. Through intermedial practices that reinvoke linguistic, literary, and cultural traditions in fangyan and Sinophone cinematic aesthetics, Blossoms challenges the linearization of history in the PRC's official history writing and reconstructs Shanghaineseness through a process of reshaping that involves sounds, voices, and lived experiences of the city of Shanghai.",33,"WOS:000417475000005",3

It considers both phonetic and non-phonetic factors, including, in its consideration of the present tense, the possibility of Slavic influence, arguing that contact within the Balkan Sprachbund provides an explanation, otherwise unavailable, of the distribution of radical-final palatalization in that paradigm.

Taylor defines himself as a self-educated poet and working waterman, and his performance of this identity-the ""Water Poet""-constitutes a significant part of his pageant book and heavily influences the themes of his pageant devices. The Triumphs of Fame and Honour presents a distinctive ""working class"" voice and is not merely an expression of the rampant commercialism typical of the Lord Mayor's Shows by writers such as Thomas Dekker. Instead, this mayoral show stresses mutability, which it links to temporal merit, to labour and to virtue in its reflection of a London of ordinary craftsmen, who may rise socially and economically by their labour and virtue. Taylor provides an alternative view of London life to that of the wealthy merchant class and the entrenched aristocracy, not revolutionary or subversive, but indicative of the emerging social mobility of the city, in which a waterman could become a popular, published poet and an apprentice the head of commercial London.",33,"WOS:000394789200002",3

Central to the story is the issue of how appropriately to commemorate German wartime suffering - in this case the sinking of a ship, the Wilhelm Gustloff, in January 1945 with a huge loss of civilian life. The story has a second subtitle, which is in memoriam'. Grass combines real historical events and people with fictional events and people. In his intertextual employment of the Novelle genre he suggests that the traditional narrative frame finds its contemporary counterpart in the internet with its websites and chatrooms. The profusion of anonymous statements which circulate there amounts to an exponential growth in oral history; but the danger is that rabidly right-wing propaganda in commemoration of German wartime suffering can be freely disseminated.

Our aim is to account for these indications and show the benefits of using a model of discourse units for the description of markers. For this purpose, we will adopt the Basel model for discourse segmentation, which regards text as a pragmatic unit consisting of hierarchically organized information units.

It is suggested that, in reinscribing the traditional bildungsroman within a Gothic discourse, this novel reveals the effect on subjectivity that the horrors of postmodernity pose for the contemporary adolescent. The employment of Gothic tropes to depict the journey of the narrator, Anwell, highlights the trauma of locating an agentic subject position in a context where authoritative social institutions have been revealed as corrupt. In such a world, typical pathways to agency are problematised. Traditional bildungsroman novels suggest agency is attained by finding one's place in the world, most often in accordance with socially prescribed schemata, although some contemporary examples confer agency through rebellion or resistance instead. Surrender posits a controversial alternative, suggesting that embracing abjection and, ultimately, death, may be considered a legitimate-if transgressive-form of agency for the othered adolescent. Rather than finding a place in the world that Anwell sees as having failed him, he demonstrates a subversive form of agency in choosing to escape from this world entirely.",16,"WOS:000415213300001",3

Beginning with the Anglo-Norman Vie de St Alexis, in which the oral performance of a letter transforms a beggar into a saint, I argue that the book's texts and images collectively display how the performance of words transforms identities and how people joined as a community through such words create a shared sense of place, an assertion that would have been confirmed by the psalms at the end of the manuscript.

First, Kashua establishes Roth's status as an author who was maligned by his community and presented an inspiration for Kashua, who has himself been accused of self-hatred. Second, Kashua presents Roth as a merciless satirist, especially of Jewish life, and thus presents himself as a much milder, forgiving writer. Third, Kashua stresses that Roth is Jewish but not Israeli, while Kashua is Israeli but not Jewish. Roth's position is only partially familiar and related to the Jewish Israeli public.

Findings indicate that in the two plays, the identities of the two leading characters of Macbeth and Othello undergo various stages of metamorphosis through which both try to form their temporary lines of flight and have their specific mode of liberation and deterritorialization from majoritarian forces that are dominant in either of the two hegemonic domains to which they belong.

"English",,,"This paper is designed to show how difficult it is for us in the twenty-first century to establish a valid response to the superlative of adjectives as used in Old English verse. In contradistinction to the monochromatically excessive use of superlatives in modern advertising, the distribution of superlatives is very varied in the English verse of more than a thousand years ago. The first part of the paper consists of a general survey of Old English superlatives, chiefly in the vernacular verse of the Anglo-Saxons, but their prose has not been wholly neglected. The study is evaluative, more so than is usual in sober Linguistics; to this purpose the superlative degree and its statistics contribute to an understanding of the triumphant ending of Beowulf, and grammar is to be seen as the handmaiden of literature. The second part of the paper is more literary, and is based on the incidence of superlatives as presented in the first part. The density of superlatives in the opening of the minor poem Maxims II is observed, without any reasoning for that density. The density of rare superlatives in the last lines of Beowulf is admired for its aesthetic quality, brought out in Edwin Morgan's poetic rendering of the poem. It is not forgotten that the rarity of a superlative in the extant verse may be because we cannot know if it would have been less rare had more verse survived. The reading of poetry must, if worthwhile, involve an aesthetic response.

Far from passively mirroring the mainstream sentimental views of the German Enlightenment, the young Schiller's moral philosophy predates those ideas which the mature Schiller is usually said to have endorsed only because of their belonging to the Kantian system. At stake is the inadequacy of love as a moral principle due to its intrinsically egoistic nature, which is revealed in Schiller's early plays. Schiller's departure from his earlier philosophy of love should no longer be ascribed to Kant, and dramatic literature should be credited with a crucial value for moral reasoning.",22,"WOS:000396720000002",3

These popular images have patterns that include primitivism, savagery, sex objectification, buffoons, anachronisms, and stereotypes. The prevalence of these images can be found in commercialism, sports, movies and television, literature and magazines, toys, the military, and endless entertainment celebrities dressed as Native Americans for fun (not roles). This paper examines the ""cause and effect"" of this phenomenon that is ubiquitous worldwide. The misinformation, lies, stereotypes, and myths about Native Americans have resulted in an image, held by both Natives and non-Natives, that is archaic at best and psychologically harmful at worst. This (mis)perception of indigenous peoples has become American schema due to pervasive and myth borne legacy.

Locating poverty law scholarship in this tradition of poverty writing has important implications for how we understand lawyering for the poor. Borrowing the idea of unlearning from Addams, this paper argues that reading literature is central to the moral task of self-definition. It may be that poverty lawyering is best understood as a peculiar continuation of a tradition of unlearning that defines the problematic of poverty writing. Orwell's work is central to understanding unlearning. In order to develop these arguments, the latter part of this paper focuses on the work of Lucie E. White. Whilst White's concepts of honesty, self-criticism, and poverty lawyering as piece work carry forward elements of unlearning, her engagement with poverty is not pushed far enough. Questions remain about the extent to which understandings of poverty law allow the work on the self to engage with the abjection of being down and out and the politics of socialism that it throws up.",28,"WOS:000413977500002",3

The analysis of the multiple alternating behaviour of the location argument in various transitive and intransitive alternations in English is mostly related to marked macrorole assignment typically to undergoer, such as in He loaded the truck with hay-as compared with the kernel construction He loaded hay on the truck-but also to actor as, for instance, in the location subject alternation, in which the location argument occupies the subject position, e.g., The bag carries all your belongings, a construction which implies the loss of one of the arguments in the kernel structure, You can carry all your belongings in the bag. Additionally, the syntactic behaviour of location arguments in marked constructions very often conveys a change of Aktionsart ascription with respect to the kernel construction, as in the swarm alternation in which the predicate in the kernel construction is analysed as an activity, e.g., Bees swarmed in the garden, whereas in the marked construction it changes to a state, The garden is swarming with bees.

However, this theory, being developed on the theoretical tools of postcolonialism, i.e. on problematizing the intentional perception of the Western travelling subject and on questioning this subject's almost innate adoption of hierarchical superiority in relation to the travelling object, cannot vitally apply to another ""conceptual reality"" in which these relations are nonexistent. After consideration of feminist reading of contemporary travel writing, the paper concludes that its, often militant, stand does not comply with a culture that knows child bringer and language teacher as a woman. To pay due respect to the text in question, the analysis turns to some of Native American authored discussions on the difference of meaning of land in contrast to mapping territory, of understanding of circularity of time in contrast to linearity of history. The paper concludes that this Erdrich's book of travel defies Theory and develops into a potent response to the dehumanizing semiotics of the Native subject and humanity in general.",11,"WOS:000400571400012",3

The surprise, challenge and scrutiny that follows offers an ethical potential to rethink one's own processes of reality-and truth-construction as well as one's bias and stereotypes. The article took examples from three contemporary novels - Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow, Amara Lakhous's Scontro di civilta per un ascensore a piazza Vittorio, and Patrick Chamoiseau's L'empreinte a Crusoe in order to investigate the ethical potential of literary misunderstandings that double the misunderstandings by affecting the characters in the fictional world and involving the readers in their individual acts of reading.

The paper examines two related arguments: first, that eighteenth-century tragedy and aesthetic autonomy are related, and that the persistent dismissal of eighteenth-century tragedy as effete and its audiences as complacently bourgeois might be overturned by another look at Adorno's ambivalent definition of aesthetic autonomy; second, that the tragedy of the early eighteenth century develops a special relationship to passivity, both onstage and in its characterisation of its own spectators, and that this passivity is understood to be a comment on tragic form.

This is a core question at a special moment in occidental history characterised by the fact of it being less and less dominated by writing, taking us to a new illiteracy triggered by the rising of an elite that expresses itself by means of programming of cybernetic data banks and computational facilities.

"English",,"GRAMMAR","This paper reports on the results of a corpus-based study that deals with a hitherto neglected kind of formal asymmetry between active and passive clauses involving two-place prepositional verbs like agree. These contrasts are found in the context of two satisfied conditions: a) The preposition in question is omissible, which holds for agree in present-day British English as in They agreed (on/upon/to/with) the proposal. b) Unlike active uses, passivization of relevant prepositional options necessarily results in preposition stranding as in The proposal has been agreed on/upon/to/with. It is shown that - in both passive and active clauses - stranded prepositions tend to be omitted more often than non-stranded ones. Unlike the passive, the active provides only a restricted range of contexts compatible with the potential use of stranded prepositions. What is more, these environments are relatively infrequent with most verbs. This is what largely explains the active-passive asymmetries with the verbs explored in this paper. Crucially, however, stranded prepositions can in several cases be demonstrated to be more strongly avoided in the passive than the active, thus mirroring their cross-linguistic distribution (see e.g. Maling and Zaenen 1985; Truswell 2009). The voice contrast is found to be independent of diachronic changes resulting in either the loss or the acquisition of the prepositions involved.",65,"WOS:000415290600004",3
"English",,,"This paper sets out to address larger questions about the relationship between postcolonialism, cosmopolitanism, and modernism from a stylistic analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of Teju Cole's Open City. While cosmopolitan place is projected as stable, time is a more open category in the novel, both in terms of the order of narrative discourse and the temporal explorations into the colonial past that the focalizer/ protagonist repeatedly offers. This allows for the often invisible postcolonial actors that both uphold the city in the present and enabled its material manifestation in the past to constantly seep into the text. Its eventual construction of postcolonial coevalness does not derive from a modernist sense of vertigo but from a cosmopolitan awareness that eventually manifests itself in spatiotemporal co-presence. Such insight into the destructive forces of historical movements is the condition of possibility for what Homi Bhabha has referred to as a vigilant global ethics of ambivalence, but always also gravitates towards political hesitation and communal aversion of which recent cosmopolitan novels have been accused.",35,"WOS:000399284200007",3
"English",,,"This paper shows how David Jones's sacramental understanding of man and world informs his, and may inform our, approach to history. For Jones, the history of ""man the maker"" is a history of ""making other."" History is not only something done, but also something made; not only a thing handed down, but also a thing ""handed over"" as anathemata; and it entails encountering the past ""under the form"" of the present. Hence it is a matter both for anamnesis and poiesis. The challenge for present makers, artists and poets, is to give newness to old forms: ""Our images, not only our ideas, must be valid now"" (""The Arthurian Legend""). The paper shows how this sacramental approach is in tension with a progressive understanding of history, with its emphasis on universal principles or rights. For Jones, ""no possession of civic, economic or political rights...can compensate for the absence of creativity"" (""Art and Democracy""). This approach is of great relevance today, the paper argues, in conditions that have been described as ""a culture of repudiation."" Jones alerts us, in the ""Preface"" to The Anathemata and elsewhere, to the danger of both language and practices losing their moorings in the matter of an inherited culture. This, then, is our task as makers and humans: ""To conserve, to develop, to bring together, to make significant for the present what the past holds...saying always: 'of these thou hast given me have I lost none""' (""The Myth of Arthur"").",7,"WOS:000445976300012",3

Scores of the one-week post-test highlight the higher recall of constructed over instructed or no gesture, in line with the predictions of the ICAP framework.

Ultimately, the novel espouses a pessimistic view of Jewish political power, and as response to the Jewish question, it exposes the insincerity of the state's offer of equal rights to Jews in exchange for relinquishing Judaism.",22,"WOS:000407084600004",3
"English","Group biography; women's writing",,"This Reflection investigates some of the questions that arise when one attempts to write lives together'. What are the intellectual and theoretical implications of this mode of biographical writing? What might be its seductions? What are its creative possibilities? It considers the place of invisible figures in group biography, and argues that the genre enables the recovery of these figures in particularly productive ways. It does so because its focus rests not on individuals but on the interstices between them. Two women receive particular attention. The first is Elizabeth Kent, the sister-in-law of the radical Romantic journalist Leigh Hunt. The second is Virginia Edgar, a friend and correspondent of Mary Anne Disraeli. The Reflection explores what happens to the versions of the past we construct when such figures disappear from dominant cultural narratives, how group biography enables their recovery, and the theoretical pitfalls inherent in returning them to the foreground. Through a sustained focus on creative experience it suggests a way of deploying the possibilities of group biography in an act of resistance towards posthumous and anachronistic constructions of significance, and argues that such resistance has the potential to be creatively liberating.",11,"WOS:000399578600009",3

The literature analyzed in this research had not previously been included in the study of Japanese literature or even colonial Japanese language literature. Even before the Japanese annexation of Korea, Japanese language newspapers and magazines had already been launched in major Japanese communities in Joseon. It is apparent that Japanese language literature in the early twentieth century was formed around the literary columns in these medias. These Japanese language literary activities in Joseon were carried out with a close connection with the both domestic and international literary worlds, such as those of Manchuria and Taiwan. After the 1930s, the development of Japanese language literature became complex due to diverse literary and cultural phenomena, and because of its sensitive response to local issues.",7,"WOS:000402692500011",3

Particular attention is paid to the description of the function, meaning and features of these discourse markers in relation to the mental representations they evoke. The high frequency of discourse markers in Dostoevskii's literary works seems to be related to his constant control over speech, especially over the collision and overlap of mental representations that occur during reading. For that reason, this article tends to be framed within the scope of the negotiation of meaning during literary text comprehension in the general context of the relationships between language, culture and discourse in Russian.

"English","Genlis (Madame de); English opera; educational theatre; female playwrights",,"This study analyses the works by Madame de Genlis and their connections to Victorian theatre. Over the course of her long and prolific career, Stephanie Felicite du Crest de Saint-Aubin, Comtesse de Genlis, produced an immense collection of works that include pedagogical texts, novels, plays, and short stories. All of her books were well received in Europe because they presented the new pedagogical ideas of the French Enlightenment but without the concepts and thoughts associated to the Revolution. Even if in Britain Madame de Genlis was best known for her children's books, her legacy could be triply conceived as that of an educator, moralist, and playwright. Such roles appeared in her first text translated into English, Theatre of Education. The book appeared in print in 1781, a year after having been published in France, which shows the interest that English readers had towards her work and the type of dramatic pieces she developed. Such interest in this author did not falter during the Victorian period. In contrast, her moral and monarchic tendencies, together with her exaltation of the personal effort to face adversity and rise up the social ladder, made her a model of the new world order. Queen Victoria's first visit was to see the Siege of Rochelle, adapted from Genlis's story Le siege de La Rochelle. Beyond an aristocratic audience, other types of theatre-goers' sensibilities were alluded to in plays such as The Palace of Truth, W. S. Gilbert's adaptation of Madame de Genlis's fairy tale, Le palais de verite. The play ran for approximately 140 performances, toured the British provinces, and enjoyed various revivals. Madame de Genlis's popularity, however, did diminish in the late nineteenth century, as Victorian critics' contempt for her work overpowered public opinion. This study offers an analytic historiographical revision of Madame de Genlis's relevance to Victorian theatre and of the type of criticism her influence generated.",42,"WOS:000422974900004",3

The manuscript begins with a prologue to his Spanish translation of the Epistola Rabbi Samuelis, a fourteenth-century Latin polemic concerning the captivity of the Jews. The prologue is dedicated to a French nobleman and fellow captive, Thomas d'Arcos, who infamously converted to Islam and whose name has been consequently blotted out in the manuscript. A close reading of the text that follows sheds further light on the translator's perspective as a ""captivo"" in the preliminaries of the epistle. It shows how Diego de la Torre's version of the Epistola-as an example of what Clem Robyns has theorized as a ""defensive translation""-associates Christian enslavement with notions of Jewish captivity, and also expresses anxieties over maintaining religious difference and the threat of apostasy in Muslim North Africa during the early seventeenth century.",37,"WOS:000398076100002",3

"English",,"MANUSCRIPT","This study focuses on the material context of medieval charms by investigating how books differ from rolls as carriers of charms. The essential difference between medieval books and rolls as carriers of charms appears to lie in the kind of unity they constitute. A roll featuring charms like the one described in the present work was probably used integrally as a physical protective device, making it the epitome of a functional unity: the whole of its contents combined with the physical writing surface of the roll itself is what defines the use of the roll. A book can certainly also make up a thematic unity, but the functional combination of contents and materiality is not as strongly present. Instead, books containing charms were more likely to have functioned as storehouses of information in a less physical sense. The texts, including the charms, could be consulted separately, and were also more likely to be perceived as such. This would explain why added and deleted texts are more commonly found in books than on rolls. The intensity of the usage of rolls, especially amulet rolls that were worn on the body, could be one of the reasons why relatively few medieval rolls survive. Ultimately, it was not the carrier that selected the charm, nor was it the charm that selected the carrier. It was an individual's purpose that determined whether and how a charm was to become part of the contents of a particular material carrier.",67,"WOS:000413904900003",3
"English","Marsilio Ficino; Morgante; Lorenzo de' Medici; Luigi Pulci; Renaissance",,"This study identifies an allegorical representation of the polemic between vernacular poet Luigi Pulci and Neoplatonic philosopher Marsilio Ficino within Pulci's epic poem II Morgante. Pulci's critique of Ficino's cultural-philosophical program may be deduced from the treatment of flora and fauna in two equine scenes from Pulci's masterpiece. Twice in the Morgante, Rinaldo's charger Baiardo is commandeered: first by the benevolent wizard Malagigi in canto 5, and then by the devil-theologian Astarotte in canto 25. In canto 5, Malagigi respects nature's limits as determined by God and delineated by Pulci in canto 24. In canto 25, Astarotte's powers and his treatment of plant and beast trump nature's limits. Astarotte's oration of Ficino's philosophy from the De Christiana religione facilitates an allegorical identification of Marsilio Ficino and Pulci's critical voice. Through this allegorical reading, tangible examples are applied to abstract conflicting cultural-philosophical programs. The Pulci-Ficino polemic is a valuable lens through which one may further comprehend the cultural complexities of Laurentian Florence, a time and place at the forefront of the Italian Renaissance.",28,"WOS:000400158400013",3

This essay explores the manner in which their memories, implicated with founding myths and elitist genealogy, expose serious contradictions in national histories. Gravity's Rainbow critically undermines the characters' desire to return to the pristine national origin and reformulates their genealogy when it powerfully generates the memory of imperialist aggression and modernizing, technological violence.

Employing a content analysis of the newspapers, we examine how culture sections have changed in terms of the cultural areas covered. We ask whether the content of cultural coverage has become more heterogeneous and whether newspapers embedded in different geographical and cultural contexts differ in this respect. To assess heterogeneity, we first focus on the opening of culture through the increase in coverage of emerging art forms at the expense of the coverage of established art forms. Next, we turn our attention to music and measure openness according to the increase of pop-rock content. The results suggest a cultural opening, albeit mostly measured by the second proxy. Established art forms hold their mainstream position, while emerging forms are validated at a slower pace than expected. Regarding music, the transformation of coverage from classical music to pop-rock is very dramatic. The findings challenge expectations about the order in which the newspapers manifest the timing and thoroughness of the opening of culture, highlighting the complexity of the factors shaping newspapers' cultural coverage.

"English","canine melodrama; Pixerecourt (Guilbert de); Victorian sensibilities; animality; domestic ethos of kindness; English dog culture",,"This work examines how, through the adaptation of the widely celebrated French canine melodrama Le chien de Montargis onto the British stage, Victorian society explored and attempted to define its own distinct cultural alliance and conceptualization of the dog. Based on a medieval legend, Le chien was originally written for the Parisian stage by Guilbert de Pixerecourt in 1814, and it immediately attracted the attention of English theatre businessmen. English adaptations soon followed, as translations from a variety of sources were presented before a public mesmerized by the feats of Dragon, the memorable canine character. From an anonymous translation to adaptations believed to have been the brainchild of William Barrymore and Thomas Dibdin, The Dog of Montargis was to be showcased throughout the greater part of the century. Such adaptations came at a highly significant moment in English history regarding the reconsideration of animality and domestic non-human others. As a result of scientific advancements and increasing sensibilities regarding 'cruel' behaviours, nineteenth-century England would witness the cultural impact of Darwinism, the reaction against continental experimental physiology (a field led principally by the French and the Germans), and the emergence of humane and animal protection societies. Within the complexity of this context, particularly as Victorian society consolidated itself in the latter part of the century, the production of a canine melodrama acquires a particular significance. This paper examines the choices made for the adaptations of the play and analyses how such aesthetic endeavours (affecting production, plot, and script, among other features) revealed a conception of the nonhuman other (in this case a species as significant as a dog) that reflected the shifting concerns on animality, their humane treatment, and their position within the overall pervasive sense of 'Englishness' and national sentiment. From an analysis of English adaptors' choice to keep the canine character alive (versus its tragic fate in the French version) to revisiting the character of Dragon through the lens of the domestic ethos of kindness, this paper explores fundamental issues related to Victorian ideals about dogs and their immersion within discourses revolving around loyalty, courage, breed, and capacity for mourning. In examining how the dog both contributes to melodramatic conventions and absorbs the growing social and scientific tensions relating to the definition of 'dog-hood', the research hopes to contribute to a better comprehension of the extent to which certain aspects of the performance (such as the dog's idiosyncratic form of communicating its feelings) represent key sites for the exploration of how modern conceptions of the non-human other were shaped.",40,"WOS:000422974900007",3

These connections also shed light on the shadowy member of Ahab's crew known as Bulkington, whose career aboard the Pequod is submerged in Ishmael's narration, but whose portrait offers striking parallels with Steelkilt's.

"English","Maps; Mapping; Identity; Resistance; Home; Memory; Trauma; Reif Larsen",,"Though many children's texts include maps that visually demarcate their journeys, modern texts rarely involve active mapping by child characters themselves, suggesting that children cannot (or should not) conceptualise the world for themselves, but require an adult's guidance to traverse it. Reif Larsen's The Selected Works of T. S.

This article examines how the act of mapping in literature often leads a character away from home to a place where the child can reconstruct ""home'' within his or her memory-a memory that instils resistance against the status quo of the child's position in life. Cartography's direct relationship with children experiments with and subverts the binaries of child/adult, fantasy/reality, civilised/primitive and home/memory of home, completely dismantling them in the specific example of Larsen's novel and demonstrating that the child protagonist's space is neither solely real nor fantastic.

Moreover, and contrary to critical notions of the shipwreck text as a counterhistorio-graphical narrative of empire, as articulated by Josiah Blackmore, I suggest that scenes of shipwreck, piracy, and tempestuous seas in the Cantigas are, in fact, carefully constructed narratives used to demonstrate-by way of divine intercession-the authority and influence of Alfonso's empire beyond the limits of the Peninsula, into and throughout the Mediterranean space.",24,"WOS:000399471600005",3

It narrates the lives of her mother, Lucie Duff Gordon, her grandmother, Sarah Austin, and identifies her great-grandmother, Susannah Taylor, as the originator of this female line of intellectual inheritance, which Ross is indebted to. This article examines how Ross's work motivates women's intellectual endeavours by presenting a positive example of female intellectual legacy sustained successfully by foremothers. A Victorian writer, historian and translator, she recognises in her maternal heritage a model of intergenerational mentorship and interaction that promotes intellectual engagement, exchange and transformations. Three Generations of English Women shows that female intergenerational legacy is central not only in uncovering the contribution of Ross's foremothers but also to a deeper understanding of the development of nineteenth-century women's intellectual life.",16,"WOS:000399578600008",3
"English",,,"Through a broad survey of fictional, religious, philosophical, and political end-time narratives, this essay identifies two strategies for telling stories about the end of the world. Apocalyptic narratives use the idea of the end to give structure to the experience of history. By narrating the end as a moment of rupture that creates an absolute division between old and new worlds, they frame history as a series of clearly defined and therefore comprehensible transitions between distinct moments or epochs. Postapocalyptic narratives complicate this neatly organized account by narrating ""ends"" as complex historical transformations that involve survivals and continuities and thus blur before/after distinctions. Rather than providing a comprehensive and therefore existentially stabilizing overview of history, they draw attention to the indeterminate nature of ongoing processes of historical change. By focusing on the conceptual understanding of historical change that underwrites different kinds of end-time narratives, the essay clarifies the theoretical terminology of apocalypse and postapocalypse, and articulates a clearer understanding of the ways in which different kinds of contemporary stories about the end of the world are used to provide conceptual support for political action in the present.",56,"WOS:000414380500002",3

Moreover, by re-reading Carta IX in the context of the Cartas marruecas as a whole, it is demonstrated that despite the seemingly contradictory viewpoints expressed by the text's trio of narrators on America, the Cartas marruecas ultimately provide a more critical and nuanced perspective of Spanish American conquest than many critics have previously acknowledged.",47,"WOS:000393716100005",3

After twenty years of living in Australia, my Polish father, Antoni Jagielski, a WWII concentration camp survivor, decided to return 'home' to Poland, to his culture and to his other family. This work uses the lens of my father's story and mine, to examine fractured families, separation, displacement, the transmission of intergenerational memory and the transnational history of post-1945 Australia. My research intervention, a field trip to Poland in 2013, unexpectedly uncovered a family archive consisting of letters, postcards, official documents and certificates, photos and material artefacts. Additional information about my father's life has been gathered from archives in Auschwitz, Mauthausen/Gusen, the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust and the Polish Institute in London.

The novel focuses on the lot of the lost children who were born in the wake of such a fateful meeting and whose narratives arc often missing from the literary and historical records even as their ghostly traces haunt today's British society and indeed the British literary canon. Yet, as this essay demonstrates, the family disruptions and sense of loss, a legacy of slavery that mars the lives of the characters, arc compensated at the fictional level by a form of literary parenthood. Tire novel relies on a fruitful intertextual conversation with other novels that, like The Lost Child, invest in the narrative reclamation of absent stories, the unvoiced accounts of orphans and lost, stolen, or denied children of the Empire. These texts include Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights (1847) as well as Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea (1966) and some of Phillips' earlier works, notably Cambridge (1991).",29,"WOS:000415665400012",3

The article brings together extant definitions and documented experiences of script development, to offer a basis from which to discuss both academic and practice-based approaches to the phenomenon. While not suggesting that the practice of script development should be standardized or limited by definition, the article does argue for the importance of investigating the available definitions and identifying the gaps in literature. By seeking out the various angles and overlaps of those researching in this field, the article proposes to begin a conversation and invite further research around what script development is and looks like in various international contexts.",63,"WOS:000418325900002",3

Horkheimer wrote his review in American exile, adeptly deciphering the anti-Nazi subtext of Haecker's inner-exile argument. The left-wing Horkheimer inevitably rejects the conservative Haecker's Catholic historiography and account of moral agency, but his review testifies to forgotten lines of continuity between inner and outer exiles. Horkheimer's commitment to a post-metaphysical critical theory ultimately shifts focus away from Haecker's theologically framed anti-Nazi critique, a shift from intellectual generosity to ideological foreclosure that anticipates the emergent polarization evident in postwar scholarship on exile in- and outside of Germany. Scrutiny of this complex critical legacy offers insight, however, into how significant theologically framed discourses remained for inner and outer exiles responding to National Socialism.",48,"WOS:000401173600003",3

The essay first examines the key elements of action and anamnesis within the Mass. It then turns to Jones's grasp of those elements as expressed in Gregory Dix's The Shape of the Liturgy, which Jones found particularly sympathetic to his own view.

The essay concludes with comments on three works of art by Jones-the painting ""A Latere Dextro,"" the inscription ""Pwy Yw R Gwr,"" and the poem The Anathemata-which take the Mass as their subject and illuminate Jones's sense of the relationship between the anamnetic action of the Mass and the historical recall intrinsic to artistic making.",16,"WOS:000445976300009",3
"English","Booster literature; female emigration; women writers; Arcadian","HOME","Throughout the nineteenth century, emigration from England to the colonies was actively promoted through promotional literature (known as 'booster' literature) in the form of books, pamphlets, newspaper and journal articles, scientific and ethnographic works, lectures and advertisements. The emigration companies and agents were undoubtedly self-promoting propagandists; nevertheless, the emigrant advice literature was highly influential. This article considers the ways in which nineteenth-century female immigrants to New Zealand drew on booster literature in their public writings. The specific focus is on three selected pieces of life writing, each of which mirrors key features of emigrant advice literature: a letter describing life in New Zealand from an unnamed settler's wife in 1852; an essay titled 'A Few Last Words About Auckland', written as an appendix to a loosely autobiographical novel published in 1882; and a booklet titled 'Taken In'; Being, A Sketch of New Zealand Life published in 1887. They are analysed through social historian Miles Fairburn's thematic frame of New Zealand as a country of natural abundance that provided ample opportunities for labouring people to achieve independence, and a society which naturally created a high level of order and guaranteed middle-class people freedom from status anxiety through a simple life.",12,"WOS:000416794300011",3

My argument extends what Andreas Huyssen suggests in the After the Great Divide, that the separation of high and low culture is a critical construct that has no real basis in the literature it problematises. My argument will be founded on the notion of intermediality. I will show that, in their engagement with differing mass media, Joyce and Eliot deconstruct this false dichotomy by merging classical works with the products and instruments of mass culture.

Despite its transregional appeal, Tilism-e-Hoshruba is little known in the West. The first English translation appeared as late as 2009, introducing it to the English-speaking world. However, Tilism-e-Hoshruba's new found accessibility does not recompense the lack of scholarly research on it. Most discussions about it have focused exclusively on its genre, ignoring the complex interplay of gender and religion that it offers. To curtail this surprising lack of attention, this paper focuses on the text's religious and gender binary by interrogating the symbolic status and narrative function of Amar Ayyar, an ayyar who deconstructs religious ideas in the guise of humor and playful performativity. Through the figure of Amar Ayyar, this paper contests the stereotypical assumptions (both Eastern and Western) about the fixity of religious and gender boundaries in Indo-Islamicate cultures in addition to challenging the hegemonic appropriation of Islamic discourse by religio-patriarchal structures in the modern era. By constantly questioning, de-centering, and challenging religious and gender values, this paper highlights the ways in which Amar opens interesting spaces for subversion.",29,"WOS:000425421600002",3

But little empirical work has explored the dynamics of taste formation implied but not explicitly theorized by the concept. Dewey enriches Bourdieu's work by providing a vocabulary to theorize processes of re socialization. This paper demonstrates Dewey's utility for understanding taste development by considering a weekly country event where no taste-class homology exists. The analysis centers on taste trajectories, or paths to appreciation taken by patrons who acquired the ability to appreciate country later-in-life. Data point to three types of regulars (Listeners, Players, Dancers); trajectories produce structured variations in experience, indicating prior engagement shapes present experience of music. Taste and experience are shown to be tightly bound; experience shapes perception and makes individuals into persons capable of having particular tastes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In Beatrice Bonhomme's livre d'artiste, La Maison abandonnee (2006), a collaboration with pastel artist Christine Charles, we follow the speaker's meanderings through a house soon to be destroyed, but ephemerally painted over by a fresco or graffiti artist who remains anonymous. Colour saturates the speaker's apprehension of the place and is presented as a catalyst to the act of writing; yet it ultimately eludes words, which prove unable to tell colour apart from light or from other senses, namely touch. But, in their discontinuous, gradually undone account of the viewing process, words can still bring out the congruity of colour's temporality and aesthetics. Violent, chaotic, and desire-driven, the frescoes seem to look forward to their destruction, presenting it as a creative process in its own right; one that will intensify their celebratory energy and their hurried, unbridled aesthetics in a moment of consummate undoing.",20,"WOS:000405587300006",3

Exploring the social and environmental degradation of the American Rust Belt, Meyer posits the post-industrial era as a period of conjoined economic and ecological precarity. The narrative veers across temporal and spatial scales, linking the casualties of the Rust Belt to other stories of dispossession and dislocation. Ultimately, however, Meyer's novel suggests that the study of literary planetary memory must examine not just the scales, but the speeds that inform cultural and critical practices of remembrance as well, analysing the uneven memorative velocities that shape the representation of diverse forms of loss across human and more-than-human milieux.",43,"WOS:000403784300008",3

He discovered moreover that passages parallel to those reconstructable for the Lincoln manuscript appear in other texts, including an important work called John Lelamour's Herbal after a name mentioned in its explicit, and concluded that Lelamour, an otherwise unknown fourteenth-century schoolmaster from Hereford, was the author of the original treatise that Thornton and other scribes used for the composition of their own herbals. The present article will present ample evidence which will demonstrate that Keiser's hypothesis on a Herefordian pedigree for this textual family cannot be sustained any longer, and that the origins of this textual family should in fact be sought not too far from Scotland. A linguistic approach based on a collection of scribal modifications, both unconscious and conscious ones (i.e. copy mistakes and changes made on purpose by the several copyists), will be used for the task. This will reveal how linguistic variation between the several manuscripts can be profitably used to reconstruct the dialect of the original translation, which will here consequently be named Northern Middle English Translation of Macer Floridus's De Viribus Herbarum (or Northern Macer for short).",48,"WOS:000415290600003",3

This essay seeks to challenge both of these assertions, and by so doing achieve a more nuanced appreciation of Betjeman's writing, through an original reading of 'Late-Flowering Lust', a poem that -at first glance -would appear to provide strong evidence for the prosecution's case. Research into the circumstances that produced this poem leads me to identify the poet's wife Penelope as its unexpected muse, and to argue that its emotional complexion is more precisely defined, and less reprehensible, than has been assumed.

This article analyses the reviews in order to determine why the hoax caused such outrage. It emerges that this narrative presents a direct challenge to Banksian notions of travel writing.

I begin with his inspiration from one of his favorite and most influential writers, James Joyce, and will close with the influence of his all-time favorite movie, Casablanca. Eco's remarkable study of Joyce's works appeared in the first edition of Opera aperta. The influence of this meticulous analysis of puns, riddles, metonymy, and interactive metaphors resurfaces with his encyclopedic knowledge in The Name of the Rose. My argument is that Eco, keeping the famous Irish writer in mind, structured his own novels as dynamic epistemological metaphors. In addition to the skillful use of parodies, irony, puns, metaphors, erudition, semiosis, details, and comic relief, The Name of the Rose reveals many of Eco's narrative strategies. Socratic dialogues, intertextual frames, citations, palimpsests, and chains of associations are at the center of his possible world of fiction where History and stories intertwine. From the cult movie Casablanca Eco learned how an intertextual collage of cliches was used constructively: two cliches make us laugh, but a hundred cliches move us because we sense dimly that the cliches are talking among themselves and celebrating a reunion. In The Rose we encounter cliches, archetypes, and familiar quotations that with Eco's encyclopedic knowledge contribute to making his first hybrid cognitive narrative an excellent example of docere et delectare.",50,"WOS:000400158400016",3

In the denial of female reproductive sexuality in the two wives (Mutter, Mama) and the literal resemblance between stepmother and child (Ines, Nesi), Storm imagines a system of female kinship constructed as a visible field rather than as the result of an unseen natural force. Through the multiplicity of female names, Storm's taxonomic strategy relies on proximity and similitude as the basis for circumscribing maternal step-relations in Viola Tricolor.

Drawing on the resources of traditional bibliography, intellectual history, and digital database analysis, this essay proposes that the ""old spelling"" Faerie Queene is as much an artifact of the mid-eighteenth century as it is of the late sixteenth-and that its relation to Spenser's intentions is less clear than the role it has played in securing norms of scholarly rigor, historical accuracy, and textual precision.

Ultimately, the article makes two original contributions to the study of transmedia narratives and the multimodal novel.

"English",,"CRITICISM","Using J. M. Coetzee's The Lives of Animals (Coetzee 1999) as a basis, our article compares the straightforward ethical reading of literature as an unproblematic means for creating reader sympathy ( as exemplified by the work of Martha Nussbaum), with an approach based on Emmanuel Levinas's sense of otherness. For Levinas, reading involves an awareness of otherness that does not control or circumscribe the other, but that encourages a continual unfolding of its possibilities. In this connection, he distinguishes between the ""said"", that which is complete, written down once and for all, and the ""saying"", that which can ""interrupt"" our readerly assumptions by revealing the presence of otherness. The sense of otherness, because so funda-mental to our interaction with the world, needs to be respected, our ethical obligation or responsibility towards it acknowledged. We believe The Lives of Animals fosters such a sense of obligation.

"English",,,"Utopias represent a crucial means of Enlightenment critique and inquiry. A general eighteenth-century blind spot vis-a-vis women as subjects and sociopolitical agents, as well as the discrepancy be tween their onerous obligations and incommensurate rights, is thrown into stark relief by two utopias: Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Julie, ou la Nouvelle Heloise (1761) and Marie Leprince de Beaumont's La Nouvelle Clarice (1767). The writers' pedagogical backgrounds inform each novel's emphasis on a heroine's education, which determines the utopian program of each society. Though both utopias place women at the centre of a complex social order, Rousseau's imagined community is predicated on the self-abnegation of the heroine. In contrast, Leprince de Beaumont's novel requires the male protagonist to re-establish his tainted virtue through marriage and the implementation of a female-dominated utopian community. Through its unmistakeable reversal of La Nouvelle Heloise's utopian paradigm, La Nouvelle Clarice functions as a dynamic critique of Rousseau's seminal plot and provides a striking vision of a matriarchal utopia that simultaneously refuses closure and any limits on women's political and social activity.",68,"WOS:000404040100004",3

Traditional accounts of metaphor have seen it as a form of comparison or substitution for literal language, or else a ""deviant"" form of semantics. This situation changed in the twentieth century, starting with the work of I. A. Richards and the early gestalt psychologists, who put forward arguments and evidence that led, by the later part of the century, to the view that metaphor was more than a digression from literal language; rather, it was a trace of how meaning and concepts are formed. The major models that are derived from this perspective are generally discussed under the rubrics of ""interaction,"" ""projection,"" and ""blending."" Each model can be described as a ""unidirectional"" one, since it posits essentially that metaphor is the result of enlisting concrete vehicles in order to shed light on (and even construct) abstract topics. By and large, these models have not entertained the possibility that metaphor is actually a ""bidirectional"" process, not only enlisting concrete vehicles to guide abstract conceptualization but also the reverse: abstract topics allow us to understand the vehicles. In other words, the parts of a metaphor implicate each other in tandem. This article will argue for a bidirectional model of metaphor. Such a model has implications for both linguistics and psychology mainly, that the traditional view of metaphor as a process that makes abstractions understandable through vehicles or source domains may be moot, even though it might have practical functions and validity in specific instances of cognition.",62,"WOS:000393270200002",3

On the basis of selected writings of Georg Forster, Alexander von Humboldt, and Adelbert von Chamisso, the author highlights the increasing speed with which knowledge, especially in the experiential sciences, is produced and disseminated following the routes of ever-widening trade speeded along by globalization. The notion of 'vectopia' stands for the connection of utopia and uchronia in space and time in such a way that the experience of the world, expanded worldwide, contains within it a Weiter-Leben, a 'living-further' that is to be understood first in a spatial, and not yet temporal, sense, of what Forster called Erfahrungswissen, or 'experiential knowledge.' Vectopia, as elaborated here, has a material dimension that relates to the physical person, the body, the experience of the world that cannot occur without the constant changing of place, without a journeying that is again and again recommenced. Vectopia develops the projection of a life not from space or from time alone, but by their combination. Vectopia is more than a concept, it is a thought-figure: it is vitally connected to life, and thus a life-figure. It opens itself to a type of knowledge that stands almost at the threshold of a further life, indeed, of a Weiterleben that, opening itself to a 'living-onward,' resides beyond space, time, and movement.",57,"WOS:000408017100001",3

This genre of writing and those networks shape the form and substance of our writing within an African research context. I examine the dominant template of academic writing style, which operates across many fields of scholarly endeavour. It enables different sorts of knowledge to be accepted as true, or to be excluded. What and how to write academically have been filtered through the colonial library, making it urgent to surface this template and its operationalizing networks of academic writers. The links between the language of academic writing, the colonial past, the field of African Studies, and networks of academics who appoint each other to posts and review each other's submissions to journals, is usually silent. They became deafening in the aftermath of what became known as the Philip Curtin debacle. This article is situated at the 20-year anniversary of the notorious Philip Curtin intervention in The Chronicle of Higher Education. Curtin suggested that academic jobs were being reserved for African American or African candidates and that the teaching of African Studies disciplines was being ""ghettoize"". It is an important moment to wonder whether, 20 years down the line, the issues his intervention brought to bear - of power, politics, networks, and colliding knowledge highways within African Studies broadly defined are still relevant. Finally, alternative forms and styles of academic writing, which may be more fit for purpose, are proposed and I touch on some of these possibilities towards the end of this paper. They include the role of fiction in academic writing; the possibility of the inclusion of the world of the gods and spirits; an interrogation of linear time and the nature of experiential knowledge in relation to academic knowledge.",28,"WOS:000397221300008",3

This essay argues that Percy Bysshe Shelley's renunciation of a narrow concept of selfhood not only informs, but germinates, his psychological and political principles, and in the process shapes his response to William Wordsworth not as an ""egotistical"" poet, but as one who paradoxically and enviably escapes mutability by being ontologically identified with forms of non-life. I argue that Shelley brilliantly (and correctly) attributes this position to Wordsworth's poetic thought through his own poetic thinking in works such as Peter Bell the Third, and that Shelley also finds such an alignment incomprehensible. His construction of Wordsworth is a skeptical dialectician's disavowal of mute or dull inclusion. The essay attends to Shelley's treatment of Wordsworth in connection to Shelley's performative speech acts of inversion: life-death; heaven-hell; blessing-curse. Shelley abjures Wordsworth for excessive love for otherwise inanimate things; for 'ma[king] alive I The things it wrought on' and awakening slumberous 'thought in sense'.",32,"WOS:000398018100004",3

I say the strongest emotion, because I am satisfied the ideas of pain are much more powerful than those which enter on the part of pleasure.

Her peripatetic encounters with European cultures-in-crisis caused Wright to despair of Europe as a source of political and creative renewal, and exposed fault lines in her own cultural orientation. Sundered from her Anglophile cultural inheritance, and able to reflect on home with the distance and imaginative ambivalence of an outsider, Wright invoked Ulysses that archetypal poetic wanderer whose experience of archipelagic journeying came to express for her the contingencies and hauntedness of Australia's palimpsestic identity.

Geometrical assertions rely on abstract thought, and the essayist would rather we concentrate on concrete measurements of the world around us. While we have until now made much of the philosophical consequences these criticisms engendered, namely that Montaigne was heavily persuaded by skepticism, we have not looked at the extent to which Montaigne was fascinated by the language of geometry and even, in his writing, obsessed with a particular geometrical debate that dates back to the very first commentaries on Euclid: the necessary, infinite separation between parallel lines and between asymptotes and their hyperbola. Montaigne's writing produces counter proofs to non-incident lines by forming parallels and asymptotes into demonstrable, everyday actions, expressing them in a more colloquial, French equivalent, and proposing the essay as a parallel figure that challenges theorems of infinite separation. The following will read these moments in Montaigne's writing as conscious and unconscious instances of his geometrical language and, in Lucretian terms, his swerve [clinamen]. Montaigne's explicit opposition to lines that never cross, specifically his aversion to the asymptote proposed to him by Jacques Peletier and the parallel lines asserted in Epicurus' atomist discourse, constitutes a geometrical language in which crossing and contact are moral imperatives that promote social togetherness and exchange.",18,"WOS:000403574900001",3

While most critics argue that Roe's binaries suggest a characteristically western perception which fails to comprehend the Oriental, this article suggests that Roe's attempt to define India by opposition to the West involves, rather, a deliberate erasure of the similarities between the two in many respects. His refusal to acknowledge the points of connection indicates a desire to deflect onto the oriental ""other"" what he wished to disown in the ""self.""

A moral evaluation of the pornographic story of a sadistic narcissist performing ""imperial"" acts of sexual exploitation in his ""bedroom"" depends on the reader's ethical position, and one might doubt whether Ellis is really ""a self-confessed moralist"" who ""far from offering a celebration of evil and of nihilism, [. . .] is presenting an examination of it"" (Akbar 2011). But as an innovative narrative, which replaces a traditional plot with a steadily intensifying mood, performs puzzling narratological tricks, combines standard elements of generic fiction with meta-fictional experiments, ingeniously plays with the ontological difference between fact and fiction, achieves the rare juxtaposition of a lingering awareness of the text's constructedness with a self-referential lack of critical distance, and creates a unique mixture of mundane items of popular culture with crucial questions about human behavior, Ellis' idiosyncratic tale is an accomplishment that certainly deserves critical attention.",53,"WOS:000404195700001",3

Despite a number of important pioneering works, however, British captivity narratives have not only remained at the margins of early modern studies, but even where they have received attention they have mainly been treated as historical source material. In other words, there has hardly been any interest in the genre of captivity narratives as a textual and literary phenomenon in its own right. As a consequence, most of the published stories in question lack thorough narrative analysis, although the genre is situated at the intriguing intersection of travel literature, religious writing (e.g. tales of martyrdom), and prose fiction, and arguably constitutes one of the forerunners of the early novel. This paper proposes that we need to go beyond the limits of current research by rereading British tales of captivity with a stronger interest in their narrative composition, their discursive and generic contexts, and the pragmatics of publishing.

But if the shawl is encoded within the molar structure of British Empire in this material archaeology, the second new materialist, molecular-force reading transforms the shawl from a tangible object into an affective body, from a metaphor of imperialism into a matterfold of affectivity, to foreground its entangled, vibrant materiality in a dynamic field of forces.

Inspired by Alenka Zupani's philosophical work on comedy, The Odd One In (2008), it is further argued that this comic undercurrent alters our perception of the protagonist and his bargain with Mephistopheles from elements in a metaphysical drama to figures in a critical exploration of the material life of ideas - especially the official religious and political doctrines of the Elizabethan state.

Many theatrical productions in both capitals offered scenes of characters reading, reciting and paraphrasing Shakespearean texts in dramatic, comic and/or burlesque settings; however, a number offered the figure of the dramatist amongst the dramatis personae. Often drawing inspiration from Alexandre Duval's Shakespeare Amoureux (1804), both French and English dramatists exploited the rising cultural capital of the Renaissance dramatist to have him directly intervene in dramatic intrigues and sometimes to assume the role of protagonist. This discussion will focus upon some of the ways in which Shakespeare was called upon to tread the boards of Parisian and London theatrical and musical stages in the period c. 1830-1870.",57,"WOS:000423221000006",3

This essay relies on Brian Richardson's term ""denarration"" from Unnatural Voices and David Herman's conception of ""qualia"" from Basic Elements of Narrative to reveal that the contemporary novel has reconceived accuracy in a nonliteral way. For post-postmodernists, experiential accuracy is more important than empirical accuracy.

The population of CJ sites increased through most of the period, foundings declined after a spike in 2005, and mortalities rose dramatically after 2010.

As the third part of a three-year project on digital inclusion in isolated communities in Chile, this study draws on findings from focus groups conducted with non-Internet users who live in three remotes but digitally connected villages, to unravel the elements associated with their decision to remain digitally excluded. The main findings indicate that strong ties within the community shelter their sense of isolation providing a feeling of closeness, whereas the internet is perceived as disruptive. In addition, negative attitudes about the Internet emerge from the discussions: the internet is associated with addiction and isolation. Finally, the absence of digital skills makes smartphones and computers unknown entities, a black box people feel unable to or overwhelmed at the thought of learning how to use. However, many are facing a hard choice due to their need to remain in contact with those outside the community as well as promote and develop their small business ventures.

As a detailed comparison of Joyce's text with the turn-of-the-century revivalist discourse shows, A Portrait undermines each of the key revivalist preoccupations (including both linguistic nationalism and ethnic essentialism), finally deconstructing the project of nation building in toto. This radical critique of nationalism suggests that, after twenty years in which Joyce studies have been dominated by attempts to displace the once-prevalent vision of Joyce as an apolitical and internationalist aesthete with a version of Joyce as, above all, a colonial Irish intellectual, it is time to once again take his commitment to aestheticism and cosmopolitanism seriously.",46,"WOS:000419615300004",3

Yet Chaucer's period did not have a compelling tradition of satire, nor did his contemporaries necessarily disdain romance. The claim that Thopas is parodic is stronger, but only if we recognize that the target of the poem may still not be romances but be internal to the Canterbury Tales. A new route to parsing the tale involves considering it within the larger frame of Fragment VII / Group B-2 as a requital to the Host's puerile literary pretensions and joking homosocial insults to Chaucer-pilgrim. Thopas's effeminate feebleness responds to the Host's emasculating jibes, and the story's failed tropes and nugatory plot humorously answer his demands for 'myrthe'. The incongruity between the story's register and content also signal the intentionality of the tale's bungling, which heightens the requital's comic effect when Harry Bailly fails to recognize it and overlooks the intricately crafted poetics of the seemingly-botched story.",86,"WOS:000411084300004",3

Taking as a test case the most popular poet of a regionally authentic American lyric, Robert Frost, I argue that Frost uses techniques of lyric voicing to critique the very means by which persons appear as familiar individuals, of a sociality or place, and therefore worthy of certain liberties and property claims. I draw upon Frost's early New England poems, his relationship with Edward Thomas, as well as his final public lecture, ""On Extravagance"" to show how he links ""drifts"" in reference and cumulative ""shifts"" in sound or sense to the lived experience of transience, particularly within the context of rural economies.

Borrowing from the latest scholarship on whiteness and/as racial dominance, this article revisits ""Benito Cereno""to show how Captain Delano's lack of belief in the possibility of a slave insurrection throughout the novella is itself an effect of racism, stemming mostly from the taken-for-granted-ness of white superiority, which Melville shows as distorting the whites' perceptions of blacks. In so doing, I will also explore Ellison's reworking of Melville's racial imagery in Invisible Man, which seems to extend the blindness metaphor to both black and white characters, re-presenting cross-racial blindness as reciprocal rather than unidirectional. As part of this argument, the article posits the inseparability of gender and race, suggesting that Ellison's depiction of white racism may be traced back to the (antebellum) definition of American manhood as free and nonenslaved, which Melville's novella both illustrates and undermines. I thus conclude that Ellison's and Melville's works skilfully anatomize, and critique, the discourses on whiteness and/as masculinity of their respective historical moments, highlighting their interdependence, but also their internal contradictions, which the black characters end up using to their own advantage.",39,"WOS:000418498200002",3

If Native Son does not idealize the historical black-Jewish convergence, nor does it seem to celebrate Jewishness as an inspiration for dealing with black oppression, rereading Wright's classic from the perspective of black-Jewish relations evinces the ambivalent race, class, and gendered attitudes that each group held toward the other at the time, ranging from black anti-Semitism to cross-cultural identification.

Into this seafaring design he has woven much epic, particularly through multiple avatars of Odysseus: Captain Shotover escaped from a -Circe-like wife and returned home, Hector Hushabye with Iliadic name but Odyssean talent for lying and self-fabrication, even Boss Mangan and Billy Dunn as manue storytellers.

For many years, the censorship of a Fascist regime prevented alternate history from being developed, but after Franco died in 1975, a Parliamentary democracy in 1976 was restored and, with it, freedom of speech. That same year, alternate history found its place in Spanish mainstream literature: Jesus Torbado's En el dia de hoy [On This Day, 1976] was awarded the Premio Planeta, the most important commercial award in Spain, second only to the Nobel Prize. This essay analyzes Torbado's novel in terms of its interrelation with the tumultuous political circumstances at the time of its publication. I contextualize it by following two main thematic axes: first, its status as one of the influential works dealing with the counterfactual scenario of a Republican victory in the Spanish Civil War (1939), and second, the prestige it conferred on the genre of alternate history that would lead other prominent Spanish writers to try their hands at it.",27,"WOS:000404322900005",3

In this context, mermaids that had been household names for ages were perceived as hybrid creatures, possibly even missing links between the aquatic and terrestrial forms of life. Moreover, the mermaid species did not seem wholly extinct: some were reported to have been sighted off the coast of Scotland as recently as in 1809 and 1812, and when the Feejee mermaid was exhibited in London in 1822, it raised a zoological debate. While some scientists such as Sir Everard Home seriously suspected a hoax, others, including Dr Rees Price, were convinced that the mermaid was the 'found link' in the chain of evolution, and were ready to accept it in the grand table of living beings in the space that Linnaeus, the father of taxonomy, had left especially blank because he thought that mermaids might exist. Nineteenth-century audiences were used to oddities. The newly discovered platypus was a more puzzling creature than the mermaid after all, but it clearly was an animal. Human 'monsters' such as Siamese twins or Joseph Merrick, the 'Elephant Man', were known and toured in fairs, but their humanity was not disputed. A contemporary form of human-animal hybridism, however, raised serious questions about the ontological definition of human nature. What started as a zoological debate heated up in an intellectual war because the 'mermaid question' was imbedded in larger issues related to hybridism. This paper purposes to explore these issues and to follow their development throughout the Victorian period.",32,"WOS:000407697600005",3

By examining an indeterminate pharmacologic at work in intoxications and diagnoses of toxicity, I demonstrate the role of intoxication in relation to various historical discourses, and colonial and commercial practices.

I argue that Coetzee deflates inherited forms of Romantic and modernist epiphany into irresolution and lack of transformation to instead create an anti-epiphany, one that recasts traditional understandings of literary and religious insight in order to explore more tentative and gradual reorientations. Drawn from a modest and careful, but open and curious, engagement with religion after secularism, these modes privilege giftedness and bearing others' burdens.

Through an analysis of five animal poems this essay suggests that both the image of ""good little Thomas Hardy"", as James famously called him, and the more typical view of Hardy as a misanthropic pessimist miss Hardy's rhetorical use of ""deep discordancy"" to promote an emergent post-Darwinian posthumanism.",24,"WOS:000422841500010",3

The original design of American government has provided ramparts against a president like Trump and his diatribes. Also, the fact that this president has been largely unable to fill positions at the highest levels of government makes it all the more difficult for him to communicate to them. The traditional media, respecting professional standards, also resist what he tries to say. Polls show that the public is also skeptical of his voice, especially when it is relayed by Twitter. The general skepticism given to him is no doubt due to the nature of his character and behavior. But Trump is indeed heard by his hardcore base when his meaning, frequently veiled, reinforces the current cultural divide in the United States.

"English","BBC; Colour-conscious casting; Colour blind casting; Henry V",,"With its substantial record of film and televisual productions, Henry V serves as a case study for reading adaptation historically. The advent of digital distribution and streaming have complicated, however, the ways in which the historical context of an adaptation may be accessed and examined. A recent adaptation, the 2012 Henry V directed by Thea Sharrock and aired as part of the BBC's The Hollow Crown broadcast, demands a methodological expansion to account for digital placelessness. Produced within the framework of the Cultural Olympiad that coincided with both the London Olympics and the Queen's Jubilee, the Hollow Crown Henry V provokes questions about the status of multicultural Britain in the third millennium. The film does so in ways that invoke both the dynamics of ethnic identity endemic to its country of production origin-the United Kingdom-as well as to motifs present in the visual lexicon of its wider international market-especially the United States. The casting of Paterson Joseph as the Duke of York manifests fissures in these local and international histories. That the Duke of York is played by the only actor of colour in the film burdens the role with new pressures of representation and interacts in troubling ways with the policies of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom as well as the trope of the Magical Negro in Hollywood filmmaking. Pursuing these twinned contexts facilitates a reconsideration of how a historical methodology determines its points of reference and pursues the ethical in adaptative artworks.",33,"WOS:000407110700003",3

Introducing Lauren Berlant's Cruel Optimism (2011) and Mitchum Huehls' After Critique (2016), the third part then shifts its focus onto the crisis of the neoliberal condition as lived in America today. Rather than insisting merely on thematic and demographic reprioritization, Berlant and Huehls are shown to strike at the very core of the literary and the human, exposing the ` cruelty' of both the novel and cosmopolitanism as residual expressions of a now anachronistic and ultimately harmful optimism regarding national cohesion and global understanding.

The cognitive perspective allows us to understand how our brains not only organize but also re-organize, as the world turns, not only our literary experience but also our ethical and political thinking. Artists and poets return to old stories and reconsider old images not because they are, as Northrop Frye considered them, successfully integrated clusters, but because they are not. By acknowledging their many threads and their recombinatory possibilities, we recognize them as affordances whose recurrence arises from their frustrating resistance to untangling. Artists continue to search for a more pleasing, a more satisfying, a more cooperative and thereby more life-sustaining hybridity between the human and the nonhuman, be that divine or machine. They return repeatedly to reuse archetypes not because they are satisfying but because they might yet be.",28,"WOS:000403740400006",3

The webtoon is a new genre of publishing Korean comics (manhwa) online, and is considered a unique case in the global cartoon market. The increase of Internet users and digital cultural consumption has established conditions for fostering the platform for webtoons and their production. In addition, the popularity of Korean dramas and K-pop has cultivated the spread of webtoons in the countries receiving dramas and K-pop. This study discusses the characteristics of Korean webtoons and their development using the concept of ""glocal culture."" The glocalization of Korean cultural contents is the combined result of local socio-cultural characteristics of Korea, the hybridization of global and local features, and the transnational consumption of the Korean cultural contents. Such glocalizing dynamics can be seen in the process of the consumption and creation of new forms of pop culture in the countries receiving Korean Wave products. The paper argues that webtoons should also be understood as an exemplary glocalization of Korean culture, representing the social and cultural characteristics of Korea, while also having an impact on foreign comics industries in the age of digitalization.

Since then, a growing secondary literature has emerged. This article organizes that literature as a series of specifications closing in on Heidegger's critical conception of rhetoric as potentially a hermeneutic of the everydayness of being with others, and it claims that our understanding of this everydayness will remain flat or partial until we situate the concept in the sequence of Heidegger's thought in the 1920s. If we work through pre-1924, 1924, and post-1924 periods, it becomes clear that there are religious, modal, and sophistic contexts for Heidegger's evolving conceptualization of everydayness. The concept of everydayness that emerges is disheveled but rich. The article concludes by suggesting that only faint echoes of these potent rhetorical trajectories can be discerned in the late Heidegger.",38,"WOS:000397005800005",3
"English","Spanish novel; Twentieth century; Ecocriticism; Bildungsroman; Ethics; Moral development",,"Within the last decade or so, several specialists of Spanish Peninsular studies have adopted an ecocritical approach to prose and focused their attention on explicit environmental concerns in novels such as Instrucciones para salvar el mundo (2008) by Rosa Montero or Alberto Vazquez-Figueroa's El mar en llamas (2011). This approach has yielded important scholarship, signaling the participation of Spanish novelists in this thematic current. The present essay, however, suggests that ecocriticism may also be fruitfully pursued in narratives whose topics may not seem overtly germane. This is the case, I argue, with Irlanda (1998) by Espido Freire, a novel that has been characterized as the bildungsroman of a young witch. Despite her shocking behavior, it is the contention of this essay that the protagonist's moral development is predicated on notions of fairness, care, and other prosocial stances that ensue from her sensitivity to the natural environment.

"English","Body; power; feminist representation of rape; docility; protest",,"Women, from time immemorial, are always considered subservient to men, and they have remained at the disposal of the head of the family, the father. They are denied their basic human rights and the 'biological control over their bodies' as woman is the sexual property of her family and at the same time her body is negotiated for sustaining family honour. The female body is subjected to regulation and control in order to achieve the intended docility, a process through which power is dissociated from the body. The guardianship of women's bodies make men proud possessor of property rights as well as self-acclaimed protector from their enemies. The body of the woman is the site for contesting where men can take revenge upon other men by violating her sexuality, thus, taking revenge on her 'owner.' Usha Ganguly's play, Hum Mukhtara, an adaptation of Mukhtar Mai's sensational and inspirational autobiography, In the Name of Honor: A Memoir, registers the protest of a victim of an institution sanctioned gang rape who later became one of the foremost figures of women empowerment in one of the most hostile countries for women in the world, Pakistan. Although the play brings out the inhuman brutality of the patriarchal society, it is a play of hope and inspiration as the protagonist emerges victorious by transcending the notions of 'izzat' (honour) and stigma to fight back against her tormentors, turning her docile body into a site of resistance. The present paper seeks to interrogate Usha Ganguly's use of the theatrical space in the play to protest against the materialisation and objectification of female body by advocating forcefully for the empowerment of women and emancipation from their bodily constrictions.",37,"WOS:000425421600004",3

Both authors departed from Stern's middle-distance realism in seeking their distinctive voices: Woolf in close-up, in an emphasis on interior modernism; Waugh in long shot, which I consider as exterior modernism. Interestingly, the intersection of these two in the early twenties reveals Woolf at her most exterior and Waugh at his most interior and thus problematises the conceptual framework within which they are often situated. I examine their respective work through a consideration of cinema, which was essential to both writers' search for their own voices: however ambiguous Woolf's attitude towards cinema, her writing style was unequivocally cinematic; Waugh, confident in his knowledge of cinema, incorporated the medium to help forge his unique style. While cinema was Waugh's method, Woolf seemed to be only interested in the cinema eye.",28,"WOS:000411078500005",3

"English","Samuel Beckett; Molloy; scatology; language; religion",,"Writers have long employed scatology for shock value, satire, grotesque humor, and as a stimulus for philosophizing. In Molloy, Samuel Beckett employs scatology not only for satire but as a touchstone in examining the themes of language, creativity, religion, and existentialism. Beckett uses excrement as a metaphor to pursue his theories of language as excess. This leads naturally to the topic of creativity, which psychologists had associated with defecation in the infant mind, and to mythology, where we also find the association with creation. In looking at religion, the scatological can be elevated alchemically through psychology and mythology, or it can be used satirically to bring religion down-Molloy traverses both paths, scrutinizing Catholicism in particular. Finally, excrement functions in the novel as a leveler, both among humans and of humans, suggesting that much of the sentiment behind the shame, disgust, and evasion of excrement is rooted in existential anxiety.",32,"WOS:000416780200007",3
"English",,,"Writing as recently as 2011, Michael Bennett asks if Salome is an anomaly in the oeuvre of Oscar Wilde (viii). Read against his witty societal comedies of manners, it certainly appears to be one. Salome has been regarded as a fine example of symbolist drama in the history of British theatre, and few critics would dispute its seriousness as such. Its growing significance in recent discourses of gender and sexuality also adds seriousness to the play. Although Feminist and gender critics show little qualms about dubbing the play as symbolist, the final tableau of a young girl kissing the mouth of the severed head seems to me at odds with symbolism, whether Salome is seen as an archetypal femme fatale, a queer man in disguise, or a New Woman as critics argue. Symbolism in Wilde's Salome is widely different from other specimens of the genre such as Yeats's The Countess Cathleen, for instance, which directly deals with a spiritual issue of the salvation of soul. Salome also lacks the fatalistic sense of doom that dominates Maeterlinck's Princess Maleine, with which it is often compared. Wilde's wayward heroine is not a victim of the invisible forces in the same way Maeterlinck's characters are. Wilde's Salome is monstrous, as Herod says: she seems to commit a crime against some unknown God (Complete Works 604). How can we reconcile her cruel passion of carnal desire with the supposed spirituality of the symbolist tradition? Also problematic in a symbolist reading of the play is the presence of the comic and the parodic, as pointed out by many critics. Is Wilde's Salome an authentic symbolist drama?",44,"WOS:000395430200009",3

According to some documentary filmmakers, it is not possible at all, because one cannot know beforehand what is going to happen.

It analyses two case studies: the writer's own films A Man from the Congo River (2010) and Kusum (2000). The first is the story of an engineer who worked in colonial Congo at the beginning of the twentieth century. It is based on diaries and other historical material, and therefore it was possible to construct a very precise script for the film. Kusum is an observational documentary film following the healing of a young Indian girl. The script was produced prior to production, but during the shooting process many core elements changed, including the main character and storyline. The form and dramaturgy of documentary films are created in the filmmaking process and in dialogue between the filmmaker and real people.

This article redresses these schematic readings by analysing how Schreiner draws on allegorical forms in order to explore aspects of her burgeoning radicalism. Focusing on one of the main allegorical thrusts of the novel, provided by the zoomorphic and anthropomorphic animal characters that descend from mythical, fairy-tale and Ancient Greek philosophical origins, it investigates how the protagonist's metaphorically significant associations with animals relate to freethinking, feminist and anti-imperialist ideas introduced by the novel. Undine thus undermines dominant 19th-century models of the primitive human or animal as less evolutionarily developed and without a political platform, which can be seen to be a liberating move when the novel is read in dialogue with Jacques Derrida's lectures on animals, and with other recent work in postcolonial ecocriticism.",32,"WOS:000417631400003",3

Despite the fact that the book was named a Newbery Honor title, many critics have found it unsatisfyingly unstructured and episodic. I argue, however, that the book is far more unified in its construction than these critics recognize and deserves study as a revelatory title about how the First World War was presented to young readers during the Second World War. In his dauntless determination to support the war effort, young Rufus shows himself to be an iconic home-front hero of precisely the sort encouraged by the United States propaganda machine. But read carefully, the book has such an air of pervasive melancholy and contains so many scenes of disappointed hopes and disillusioned dreams that it can be read as encoding doubts about the first war's legacy. Despite Estes's clearly intended attempt to provide hope for young readers, the reality of World War I's ultimate failure haunts Rufus M. as a sort of pentimento, a darker set of images revealed beneath the text's surface optimism.",20,"WOS:000401423100001",3

Art and beauty, removed from the hermetic sites of philosophy and official knowledge, become expansive categories in Smith's text, spilling over into the social world to mark the intimate, everyday, embodied, and sensate experiences of a multicultural cast of characters orbiting the institution and navigating its politics. Tracking the various ways On Beauty's minoritized characters are forced to negotiate the spaces in and around the university, this essay highlights how those routinely excluded from the sites of institutional power deploy aesthetic strategies as resistance. This ""intersectional aesthetics"" prompts a reconsideration of the foundations of an aesthetic judgment rooted in Enlightenment notions of disinterest and universality, which ultimately prove to be thinly veiled racist and patriarchal requirements for subjectivity and citizenship.
